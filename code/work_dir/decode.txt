you know , one of the big <unk> in the travels , and one of the pleasure in the <unk> &apos;s research is in common with people who can remember to live on the old days , and they &apos;re still able to feel in the wind , they touch it in the rain .
and just the knowledge that <unk> is still traveling beyond the milky way , or the importance of myths the oldest of the inuit of the inuit are still full of meaning , or that in the himalayas , the kepler is still <unk> the breath of anthropology to memory , which is the idea of the reality of anthropology , which is the idea that we &apos;re living in .
and of course we share all the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we have to be able to do with the <unk> separation through the death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique sense of <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a role in the woods in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior in the middle of the sahara , or the warrior in the middle of the sahara , and this is the colleague that i &apos;ve traveled to a month in the desert .
all of these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can only fulfill hope .
together , the <unk> cultures form a network of <unk> and <unk> life that &apos;s the earth <unk> , and for which the earth is as important as the biological <unk> , which you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and <unk> , as the <unk> of all thoughts , and dreams , myths ideas , inspiration , inspiration , and so that has been created by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re doing as an amazing species species .
and the same way that biosphere became a lot , this was happening with the <unk> -- only with even bigger pace .
not a biologist , for example , to say that 50 percent or more of all kinds of years ago , because it &apos;s not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the field of biological diversity -- is not quite what we &apos;ve known as a <unk> of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when everybody was born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken on earth .
now a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a device that finds the soul of a specific culture to the tangible world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a tipping point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we sit here in monterey , it &apos;s not half the ears of children .
they don &apos;t teach the kids . that means if nothing gets done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lonely than being <unk> , to be one of the last of your people who are talking to your language , who are talking to your language , you know , the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope ?
and yet , in fact , this terrible destiny is actually doing someone else on earth , about every two weeks , because of every two weeks , one of the older man and takes the last <unk> of an old language in the grave .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if the world is not a better place , if we &apos;re all talking about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be <unk> . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you suddenly see how if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
that &apos;s why i want to take it in a way of a trip through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to try to understand them , which is actually lost .
now there &apos;s some of us who forget that i &apos;m saying , &quot; various ways of his life , &quot; really different ways of being .
so , for example , this kid &apos;s <unk> in the northwest northwest northwest of the amazon , the people in the northwest northwest , believe that they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the east , from holy snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t cognitively cognitively between the colors of blue and green , there &apos;s the <unk> of the forest where people depend on .
you have a curious language and a <unk> that &apos;s called a linguistic <unk> <unk> : you have to marry somebody who speaks to another language .
all of this is in the <unk> past , which is curious about these big houses where the <unk> of six or seven languages are talking about , but that you never hear somebody who learn a language .
they &apos;re just going to hear , and start talking .
or , one of the fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , which was the first one in the year .
in 1957 , five <unk> were trying to put in touch and made a <unk> errors .
they took <unk> photos from the air , which is what we &apos;re going to rate as a friendly gesture , and you forgot that these people from the rainforest in your life never seen something .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying behind the face or to see the character , nothing and <unk> , that this is business business business , and they killed five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> were not just <unk> to the spear .
they <unk> each other .
70 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we were developing the <unk> eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we <unk> the people who had been so old that he died , he died , he died , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear <unk> of the forest that was amazing .
and they could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal species was about .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing task when i asked my professor at harvard , if i asked my professor in harvard , whether i was interested in haiti and the secret societies that were used the foundation of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which was used to make <unk> .
in order to give you a sense of a sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief , and it &apos;s not a cult of black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex <unk> worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i &apos;d ask you questions that would have a big world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is always left away , because the guess was that there are no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course there &apos;s no religious belief . of course , it &apos;s just a profound religious thought , which was during the tragic diaspora .
but what &apos;s so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living tells the spirits .
the spirits can be <unk> by the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to turn the soul of the living , so that the <unk> for a short <unk> moment will be .
<unk> people like to say , &quot; her white go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to cut away from the mind , how can you get damage ?
you see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> charcoal without burning <unk> , an amazing example of the ability to affect the body that it &apos;s going to be <unk> when he gets into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met , the <unk> of the sierra nevada <unk> de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization , which has flown the caribbean <unk> of colombia , and in a consequence of the site , this people moved to a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is about the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that have never been conquered by <unk> .
until the day , you &apos;re going to be governed by a ritual priesthood , which is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> will be separated by the age of three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of the darkness , at the middle of the glacier on the middle of the glacier for 18 years , and two times from the middle of the glacier for 18 years , which they spend in the lap of their <unk> mother .
and during all this time , they &apos;re separated in the values of their society , values that makes the claim that your prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the environmental -- balance .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , she suddenly took one day , and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 years , you can see a quick , and in this <unk> moment of the first light , and the priest is going back to the very amazing landscape of the first light , suddenly everything you &apos;ve told in the universe .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think about china and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> , and the old piece of the really wild wild <unk> , which in his play is a <unk> thought , or on the other , these people are more with nature than we do .
so , there are neither <unk> , you &apos;re not going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
it &apos;s not a lot of space for it in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have been shaped by time and ritual , who can only be aware of the idea of being aware of , but in a way , the idea that the earth can only exist .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the <unk> , which is in the belief that the mountain is a <unk> , which is a <unk> or your destiny , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to this resource or this place , which can become a bunch of rocks .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
that made me to another people as my friends under the <unk> , who believe that this forest of the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits and the <unk> spirits , who would live in the world of the world .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph that i took only april in the northwest northwest northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which is a lot of you heard , the most powerful <unk> for the repertoire of the <unk> .
so what &apos;s so fascinating is not just the most important potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s going to do it , it &apos;s actually made of two different sources . on one side , there is this wooden <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , which is going to be a series of <unk> .
this plant contains a few very strong <unk> that serotonin , <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen this stuff , if you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this is the substance that they create from various ways that they &apos;ve created .
so this powder is to <unk> it &apos;s like a <unk> at <unk> , <unk> from <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to make the reality of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have a professor with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man , who was the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the <unk> years , and i said that in which you feel the effects , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
but the thing about <unk> is that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be made by a human gut , of course , <unk> enzyme with names .
you can only be taken in connection with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now , the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that contain in the <unk> , are <unk> by exactly the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself .
how can these people come out of 80,000 kinds of plants that are not able to find these two <unk> plants that are able to put these two <unk> plants that can create a kind of <unk> version , so that this is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and errors , which turns out as meaningless .
but you ask the american american say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> that they all recognize in the forest in the forest , which is a kind of <unk> for our eyes .
and then you ask them how to get your <unk> and say , &quot; i thought you understand something from plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 variants at <unk> , and they sing in a different <unk> .
well , you don &apos;t get a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
well , this is the problem of the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the very difficult position of native states , and they look at it as a <unk> and <unk> , but in fact , in the past , the real world , which is the real world .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century in 300 years , in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather than a era of biological and cultural diversity on the planet either active and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> didn &apos;t heard less to sioux , when she bow and arrow tasks , when americans stopped americans , when they stopped the horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you &apos;re <unk> in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the peak of the decline , and this is dynamic living peoples , their existence will be <unk> by the <unk> of the forest , which is a <unk> of asia in the forest , which is a <unk> of asia in the forest .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;re going to see that ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people will be convicted of people , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lives of human beings , isn &apos;t just convicted , but general and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand that suffering doesn &apos;t understand , if you haven &apos;t experienced it on <unk> level .
i went back to a young colleagues 6,000 miles from <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and only when i came up , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear . 6,000 holy monuments that have been killed by the revolution .
the father &apos;s father was identified as the <unk> of the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle <unk> with their holiness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned as punishment for the crimes of wealthy .
he was in prison in the age of two years to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister was doing this courageous , was brought into a <unk> .
one day she came out on a <unk> <unk> , and they had to <unk> them for seven years into a heavy house .
the suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really want a choice . if we want to be in a <unk> world of <unk> , or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist before she died , that it &apos;s their greatest fear , that while we go to a thread , <unk> , <unk> worldview , we would have to see the whole range of human imagination , and you have forgotten that there was ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species may exist for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us to agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> , and the hierarchy , specialization and surplus created -- only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
well , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we have to stand in the next millennia .
if we ask these <unk> <unk> after the meaning of human beings , you &apos;re looking at 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness , who are aware of all people and gardens , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took at the northern <unk> end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years of our rule , they were forced to draw in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold , they used it to their benefit .
the <unk> of their fish were originally made of fish that was made in <unk> .
the grandfather of the man was afraid of the man wasn &apos;t afraid of the arctic .
he <unk> out , and he took his pants out of <unk> and <unk> into his hand , and when the feces began to sit , he formed it in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> on the pages of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog , and she was a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog , and she &apos;s a sled , <unk> another dog and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> .
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and this is a symbol of a symbol of the inuit of the inuit and all the native indigenous .
the canadian government gave the complete control in april in 1999 , the complete control is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s a independent area . they &apos;re all controlling .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , a state , which can look for their people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , how the dreams of our own children are part of hope .
and finally , what we &apos;re ultimately trying to do in national geographic is that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not powerful , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines will be read by millions .
and we businesses a series of travel in the <unk> , where we take our audience to places from such cultural wonder , that they &apos;re going to be able to think from the entire state of anthropology , and hopefully , you can think of one after the other <unk> of the anthropology , which is that the wisdom of all people can do .
thank you .
what i &apos;m first for you first to show you is the basic work , a new technology , a new technology that we &apos;ve got microsoft as part a year ago , and it &apos;s a environment where you can either deal with huge amounts of visual data .
we &apos;re seeing many , lots of books on digital photographs of digital photographs , which you &apos;re looking at and constantly <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it &apos;s no matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a level of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because the only thing that &apos;s the performance of a system like this , is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove it &apos;s really about a text and not to be a picture , we can actually do something like this , to actually show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and no picture .
maybe this is a artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and you really have the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also have something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than in a normal display , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see you here .
or other models , or even technical .
and this is really these ideas to make this limitations for the available space on the screen .
we hope that this is not <unk> and other silly , it should not be necessary .
of course , it &apos;s a really obvious application for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
but these are all roads in the united states .
<unk> up on the <unk> image of nasa .
let &apos;s do something else now .
this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies together .
one is <unk> , and the other one is a very good research about <unk> , which from noah <unk> , a <unk> of the university of washington , under the <unk> of steve <unk> in the <unk> .
and rick <unk> from microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that , if we create this kind of beliefs where we can go through images and make this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial range of the images is actually meaning .
the <unk> have these images together with the real space , which is the real space in which these footage that were made all over the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> in the canadian <unk> , and you see these elements of <unk> slides , and these things have been able to put together .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there is what that &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
i &apos;d like to show right right now one of the <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is from a very early prototype of <unk> that we &apos;ve worked in summer to show you what i think there is really the punchline behind this technology , which is <unk> .
we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral of the lady , which was completely made in the computer with images from flickr . give them to flickr in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in <unk> , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in this model that was discovered as to this model .
so this is all <unk> , and they all have in the middle space in this way .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very thankful for the reception .
so , i suspect you can see that this is many different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the <unk> to professional <unk> , a rather large number of you who were all <unk> in this environment .
and when possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird .
many of you are from faces .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster from dame lady that was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the entire collective memory of it , like , visually the earth looks -- and everything will be connected .
all these photos are connected to each other , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen <unk> in virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s about the complexity that people use it , and it grows to the user , and it &apos;s always bigger for the user .
their own photographs are going to be able to <unk> a different person .
if someone did the hard effort , and all of these saints and you can tell you and tell you who all of you are , then my photograph of this data , and i can use it as a point of <unk> social experience , and i can use it as a point of <unk> social experience .
and of course , byproduct of all of those are the immense rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that are not just through <unk> or satellite satellite and so forth , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i get it right ? your software allows you to a certain point , within the next years , in the next years , all the images that are used by someone in the world , will be used in principle .
yeah . they don &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to make it <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the amount of <unk> information that have many of these images .
how if you do a <unk> for images , where you &apos;re looking at sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about that , which is this image .
but how would it be , if the image you connected to all your images ?
and then the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount that makes it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
well , this is really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which is how i hope to do with other things that you &apos;ve heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections , if you haven &apos;t already noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal , that &apos;s the most important of our citizens of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the <unk> of the freedom .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , secure , a <unk> premise for human beings .
if people have freedom , all of us have to do for yourself to do the things that we maximize our own health , and no one has to decide .
the way to maximize freedom is choice .
and the more choices people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
this is , i think , as deep in our water supply , that it would not come to question .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . it &apos;s not big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different <unk> <unk> , and 12 <unk> they could buy a huge number of their lettuce , in the unlikely case , that it &apos;s not going to be right in the store .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> store in order to have a stereo program -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> , and in this one electronics , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can put <unk> million different <unk> plants from the components that will be offered in that business .
you must admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you know , you could put every telephone with you , as long as he came from beethoven bell .
you &apos;ve got her telephone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
now we have an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and should you have seen that until now , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is to get people to walk into business and to ask this question .
now you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are very much <unk> than buy things that are the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could make b or we could make b .
one has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you would be , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the responsibility of the responsibility for someone who knows nothing , and that &apos;s why you know nothing in the best constitution , and that &apos;s why the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> medicine for people like them and me , that if you think about it , no sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you do for us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you &apos;re expecting to call you the next morning , and to ask a change change .
something like our identity is now a question of choice as this slide .
we don &apos;t <unk> identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re doing that as many as we want to do .
that means that every day when you wake up at the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost every one had one , and they could put it so fast as they could , and then kids were able to get them .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
today everything is easy .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i only have children , or not a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether that means all the tasks i &apos;m going to get to you and don &apos;t get good grade in my course .
and in fact you should do that . this is important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to work as carl this , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every day of every place on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a way , by the way , in the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you that the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have to meet in terms of work , and again , and again , whether we should be working or not work .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry to other hip , and our site probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all off , every minute in which we put our child at the <unk> of a <unk> , we ask us , &quot; should i suppose that call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and also , if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it will certainly be the experience of your child &apos;s experience very different than it was .
wherever we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we were living .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we &apos;re now seeing life .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to get this bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
it &apos;s a effect , <unk> way , is that it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
with so many options that you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to choose people at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example , a study of investing in volunteers in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a decade of <unk> who had been <unk> , which took participation for two percent .
they offer 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees than if you &apos;re just 5 , why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> , which is so hard to decide what you &apos;re supposed to choose to choose it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course .
you know , that &apos;s not only means that people have to eat dog food , because they don &apos;t go enough money to do it , it &apos;s so hard to make the decisions that they &apos;re missing big <unk> .
through that , they give them to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year from the <unk> , who had been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think that &apos;s what the world looks like .
you really want to make the decision right , if it is for all 11 , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment in the house , or even the wrong thing .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we get rid of the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the result of the choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide to decide .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is to take a lot of choices through the great choices , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what happens is that you could have a different decision to make the decision , and what happens is that you could have a different decision .
and the more possibilities there is , the easier is not to regret that &apos;s a little bit of the choice that they make .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point in the morning by he told how much the way we rate things about what we compare .
well , if there is very many alternatives to think , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that they &apos;re <unk> , that makes you less happy with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here is what you would have to think .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive experience .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i park right before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the idea that he missed the opportunity to have a great parking lot .
<unk> <unk> the happiness that we get through our choice , also , if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more ways there are there to be choices , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take into the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some tell you .
he &apos;s doing a statement about this , and maybe it &apos;s very slow about things .
but an important point that he does is , always who you decide to do for one thing , you don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less .
third : <unk> the expectations .
this has met me when i wanted my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of a way , and they bought them , and you bought it , and they were <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had a long time , they were going to be &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans for many years of the age of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the doctor said , &quot; do you want <unk> , easily <unk> or long ?
do you want buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut long , <unk> , blah blah blah , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered me , i &apos;d like to have the way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour for all of that damn jeans , and that &apos;s the business , and i say the truth -- with the best right jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all this choice allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt worse is that i was worse with all these options , my expectations for a good few jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations as it was in a way .
when you were in 100 species , a damn damn , one of you should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so , i compared what i was going to get to what i expected , and what i had had was disappointing to what i expected .
so the add of possibilities in the lives of people are inevitably increasing the expectations of people as well as well .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even if the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that all better was better than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was a very surprise for people who were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world in which we live -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for you can ever hope to do it .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because your expectations , my expectations are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what you all come up -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i wouldn &apos;t have done it better . i don &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
and finally , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad , sit jeans , if there is just a way to buy that if they &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask questions why , the world is , what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy a <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse me for errors .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results are good , they feel disappointed , they &apos;re <unk> yourself .
clinical trials exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people know that people have gotten up because your standards are so high , and then if you have to explain this experience .
and so this is the <unk> that we &apos;re generally doing better , meaning , and we feel worse .
so let me remember .
this is the official <unk> , which is that we &apos;re all wrong for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is a little choice better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choices better than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for a long time that we &apos;ve missed the choice of our current .
now , as an <unk> question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as an <unk> question , the thing about thinking about this , and what all these choices are allowed to do in the industrialized societies , which is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is that they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange issue of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and <unk> : steve <unk> told you about how those more expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help it .
you even hurt .
they worry about that .
if something from what the people of our society allows us to make decisions to the societies where people would have a little bit of choice , it wouldn &apos;t only improve life , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to worry about it all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these great choices we &apos;re doing .
finally , read this cartoon , and i &apos;m looking at this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i have thought about this , the more i know the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> so that everything is possible , you cut happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost to limited security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is the <unk> of a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , talking about the human genome and what it could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re going to start from a new point : we &apos;ve got biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from digital code in a new phase of biology by creating new life and build new life .
we &apos;ve always tried important questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i believe that many biologists are trying to understand , and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> , the change of the analog world of biology in the digital world .
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions whether we can regenerate life or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , which is the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our own . trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we look at all these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would have a living cell .
so we decided that there &apos;s the only way to the front of the beginning is actually what allows us to vary the individual components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we imagine a chromosome ?
could it really allow the chemistry to make this really big molecules that hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
so a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but then our last point would go on an exponential curve .
we started this 15 years ago .
it was actually a couple of years from a <unk> review before we made the first experiments .
as it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to create small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of power , the more errors .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together and make the errors .
that was our first attempt to try from the digital information , the genome &apos;s x x .
it &apos;s a smaller virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , they made a <unk> and had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase phase , when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and put into a bacteria , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles have been released by the cells , and came back and killed e.
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that you can understand this model .
they laughed more than you do it .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that actually can actually build the hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome , and it &apos;s more than <unk> letters of genetic code , so we thought we could make it in <unk> , which is the same components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information must be really accurate .
when we &apos;ve sequenced the genome at the first 1995 in 1995 , the <unk> was a 10,000 <unk> .
we found the <unk> 30 errors . if we used the original sequence , it would never be possible .
part of the design is it to make pieces of the 50 letters , and they have to have the other <unk> pieces , and they need to build smaller <unk> , so they &apos;re doing this fit .
we have unique elements here .
you might have heard that we &apos;ve got <unk> .
think about this : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters is about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
so we &apos;ve created the pieces so that we could just cut them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these repair and over again .
and we started building pieces , starting to get the five to <unk> letters , put these together in order to make these together to make these together , to <unk> this again .
in every step , we have these pieces in the surplus so we could sequence them because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to this really big pieces -- with over 100,000 continents -- they &apos;re not just going to grow into e.
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> , which uses biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you look at the upper field that its chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , all over the way it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m sure that life exists in space and move around , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes , actually , we &apos;ve been using the right design with the right design of the pieces , we put them together . yeast is automatically automatically .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can even see it with the <unk> .
that &apos;s footage about a long of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve just asked you recently .
this is about <unk> letters of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we print it with a <unk> of 10 and without the distances of print , it would include pages of pages , just around this genetic code .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re doing it in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus , and there &apos;s another place , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the shelf .
in <unk> , the chromosome is the chromosome in the cell , but only recently , we &apos;ve shown you can do a full transplant of a cell to others , and it can activate it .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . roughly said , these two times as people and mice , and we gave some <unk> on that , we could choose that chromosome , and it was very amazing when we gave it in a cell -- and they &apos;re going to have a very <unk> graphs .
the new chromosome went in the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process to something .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we can find all kinds of the species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , every time thousands of characteristics in only a second .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene has changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are called the <unk> , they &apos;re actually called dna .
so the chromosome that has been in the cell was no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was <unk> in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s blue because of the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re walking through .
it likes to be <unk> <unk> , but we can do it by taking the <unk> , things quite dramatic .
now i mean that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i mean that we might be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion where there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious for what we need .
we &apos;re from half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context , i was born in today .
today , three people are on this planet for everybody who exists in today , within 40 years .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for four billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for 9 .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . these are a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is all the co2 co2 from this material land in the atmosphere .
so we &apos;ve now got out of our discoveries from the entire world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and you can see the diversity on that .
we &apos;re in the first line of the biological reality , and for those of our idea .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of these quick <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
so we have the opportunity to build a big robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine this 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to create <unk> or drugs , new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> by <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> and so forth .
so this is a picture of the real <unk> that we &apos;re working with that you actually sit down and make new species on computers .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look , we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
so we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen a half times a half times a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got fuels from the <unk> and third generation that are relatively soon going to have a lot more <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way of biology is a huge impact on the cost of food , or the shake of their availability of their availability , if we see co2 as the world , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go to this way .
and we think that we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , at almost <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s co2 co2 in methane to use hydrogen as a energy source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could just be brought into <unk> , the co2 can be brought into the fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve the basic questions of life .
you know , we &apos;re really -- <unk> targets like the <unk> of the entire <unk> industry , right . if you could not do that at ted , where otherwise ?
but the same thing we &apos;re doing right now is the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;ve always seen a year on the back and have a dollar in the back , and you go a dollar .
i think that can be changed by taking <unk> vaccines in <unk> vaccines .
this is what the future may be like to look at with changes , can be accelerating today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we &apos;re light light light from it to improve people , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to make it . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to go back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s too much . and for all those who haven &apos;t been there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that ever been studying -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions , which is less than a <unk> second after the beginning of the universe , and that , to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called a brown detector -- 44 feet in diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular image of the atlas of the atlas in the process that you can see .
at september 11 last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge <unk> in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which is the entire way to <unk> the lhc , then to <unk> a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles in the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image at september september , we knew the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is the largest <unk> , or that , as someone went to google page , and the page page that was so found .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the science .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine which was doing with this wires here -- this golden wires here .
these wires can produce <unk> <unk> when the machine goes on .
well , the engineers among you will look at and say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t do . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that , because if you cut them very far , they will be called <unk> .
so at minus <unk> degrees , when the space between the stars , these wires can make the tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and they turn the wires slightly and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
well , it &apos;s still wonderful if you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and weigh around about 30 inches .
so we have about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all over again .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and expect first data in june , or july , can be able to collect our journey to find out what the blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way of doing this accidents again , the value of science and <unk> on the limitations . it &apos;s easy to reject that .
i think the fact that it is so hard to reach the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words for english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i suspect , when he was the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his apprentice was michael <unk> , and he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , and that there is no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
but the recent thing is a weird thing in my life and my career that brought me to rethink my relationship with this work .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , decided unlike all my previous books in the world and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m going to be treated .
seriously -- the peak <unk> !
so , for example , they come around to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t fear that they will never be <unk> .
don &apos;t you fear the fear of your life and never create a book that &apos;s interested in the world ?
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember it , that i was talking about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager for the first time , i told me that i was going to be faced with the same way of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> , you don &apos;t fear , never going to have success ?
don &apos;t you fear that will kill you a <unk> ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to take your life for life , and that &apos;s never going to come up on a <unk> dreams , and your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
so , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had that .
and i &apos;m going to fear a lot more things that nobody would see .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but if it &apos;s about writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about and ask me , why ?
is that key ?
is it sense of somebody should be expected to be afraid to do the work to do the work ?
and what is right to do with the creative company that they make us insecure about the creative quality -- in a way , how to do other jobs ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist when he was asked to be afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about it ?
it just came out , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemists have not received the reputation of <unk> people .
and we seem to seem to seem to have this kind of reputation , but not only the writer , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to seem to be mental incredibly unstable .
all of what you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great people alone from the 20th century alone that died young and often died .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have <unk> , they seemed from their talents to be <unk> .
norman <unk> said short before his death in his last interview : <unk> every one of my books has killed me a little further .
a extraordinary statement you can do about you .
but we don &apos;t even get somebody to say something like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of talk about a long time , and somehow we &apos;ve seen the perception of this , and collective , of course , that art and suffering , of course , is going to be in the end .
the question i want to ask anybody here today is this idea for you all right ?
do you think about that ? because with only one centimeter away , i feel not that i don &apos;t know with this perception .
i find it .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she &apos;s taken by the next century .
i find it better if we &apos;re doing our great creative encourage .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start , start to start , to start , this dark path , and particularly in the fact that i &apos;m right in my career .
that means -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just 40 years old .
i might have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s really likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world as the work , which came to the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s highly likely to be my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thoughts that you can get somebody to start to drink 9 &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would have to keep trying to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seems to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to write a kind of <unk> psychological design .
and somehow , i have to find a way of a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction is going to be in the writing .
while i was looking for models in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for that , i was looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you might help better or <unk> ideas about the emotional risks that are associated with creativity .
this quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe creativity from people , ok ?
they thought creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine <unk> of creativity , <unk> demons .
you know , from socrates , he thought he would have a <unk> , he would have to tell him <unk> .
it had the same idea , the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative mind , <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they thought that a genius of these kind of magical creature was , which was actually , literally , in the walls of a <unk> -- about something like <unk> , which would be invisible , and the artist in the work of the work would be invisible .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i was talking about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist &apos;s artists was protected by certain things , like , for example , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at anything for you . everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not completely your errors , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a <unk> .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came out and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was , let &apos;s ask the human individual in the universe -- about all the gods and mysteries , and there is no space for your divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from its own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people , or those artists call a genius -- instead of being a genius .
i must tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of a naked person , he thinks it &apos;s like the <unk> , like the hallway and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence and the essence , is a little bit too much responsibility to <unk> them .
it &apos;s like somebody to do the sun .
and that &apos;s a <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it generates all these <unk> expectations .
i think that this is our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can do this <unk> for 500 years , we can &apos;t just cut out in a <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience , which is really <unk> scientific doubts about the idea of -- essentially -- <unk> , the people and <unk> on their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to say is : why not ?
why does not think about this ?
because it makes a lot of sense like anything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that you know -- as anybody knows that has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always relevant .
in fact , he can feel quite a <unk> .
i &apos;ve recently met an encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet poet stone , which is now about 90 , but she told me that she was working on the fields , and she told me that she was working on the fields , and she told me that she was doing a poem about the landscape .
she said it was like a <unk> train .
the over the country would be <unk> .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that you could only do a moment , and that was -- it was -- in your words -- <unk> race like the devil .
she ran out like the devil in the house while she was done by this poem , and it was the only one that she had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen , so she had to be able to capture it , and it was able to capture it .
in other , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the poem she was walking through , and she told it , and she told it to go on land .
and then there was these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost told it .
so , she goes up to the house , looking after paper and the poem , and the poem is driving through her , and she picks up a pen when it comes through you and then -- she said -- it was as if you get to your other hand .
she caught the poem on his tail , and she went back to your body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in this time , the poem came up and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first word .
when i was doing this , i thought , this is an amazing -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i have to stand up every day at the same time , and sweat , <unk> , and really awkward <unk> .
but myself , even i &apos;ve got this thing to do this thing .
and i guess that many of you have done this .
even i was working on work or ideas that made from a source through me that i really don &apos;t identify .
what about a thing ?
and how do we go to the relationship with our mind without losing our mind , but we even think about mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how you can do this , the musician of tom <unk> , and i was allowed to interview him a few years ago .
we were talking about this issue . and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern artist , which was trying to be able to understand these <unk> creative impulses that live in him , and with them .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me that he was driving one day on los angeles , and there &apos;s all about him .
he was driving at a high pace when he was a little piece of a melody , which is the way it &apos;s a lot of , it &apos;s hard for him to get it &apos;s hard , and he wants to do it . it &apos;s <unk> , and he can &apos;t do it .
he didn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have pen ; he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he begins to get this old <unk> in him , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to get rid of this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of trying to get into panic , he just stopped .
he finished all the thought and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , <unk> excuse me , you can &apos;t see that i drive car ?
<unk> , i see this as a song , i see a song ?
if you really want to exist , come up to a <unk> moment when i can care about you .
if you don &apos;t , you know somebody else .
go and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . that was often as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds it was like he was <unk> the genius out of it , where he was doing nothing as in trouble , and he realized it &apos;s not a <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing that was not tom .
when i &apos;ve heard this story , it was a little bit of the way i worked , and it has been saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell in one of these <unk> in which we &apos;re all working on , if we &apos;re working on something , and it &apos;s going to be the worst book that ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just make the project .
but then i remembered , like tom in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i put my view from the manuscript , and i was talking to my comment in an empty corner of space .
i was talking loud : <unk> , you know , you , and i both know if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not all my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;ve got everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to get up here , and you &apos;ve got to follow your proportion .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to be able to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a look like today , i was here today for my work .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like follows , centuries ago , in the deserts of <unk> people with holy dances and music , who were stopped hours -- until the dawn .
this strong was always great because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but back and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen a performance in your life .
it was when the time was <unk> , and he was going to go through a kind of <unk> , and he did nothing else than he did before -- 1,000 nights .
and all of all , he didn &apos;t know more human .
it was <unk> from the inside , and it was <unk> , and it &apos;s all <unk> through a <unk> fire .
as something that happened at the time , people knew what it was . they called it on his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came from <unk> <unk> , they took this practice with this , which was the course of the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you &apos;re still talking about in <unk> and <unk> .
if a actors in spain in spain , something is done something magical : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> view of the god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part , the next morning , when the dancers wake up , and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s not a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knee , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to this heights .
and maybe you can never call another god name if he turns out , but what would he start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe by the beginning , that the most extraordinary thing of their existence came from them .
if you might just believe that you &apos;re a little bit -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life that will be passed on somebody else when they &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think of security in the last months , while i was working on the book , as i worked on the book , it &apos;s going to be soon -- as the dangerous , a lot of the most dangerous time of my <unk> success .
what i &apos;m constantly going to say to myself if i &apos;m going to be nuts about it , it &apos;s not a fear .
not <unk> .
just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution there , whatever he might be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius that is asked you to the page , decides for a short point of wonder , to show a <unk> of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if you don &apos;t , dancing your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you at all .
i believe that , and i think we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you , just for you , that you &apos;ve just human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had been the size of the bottom of 48 states , and 40 percent less .
but this is not very much enough the seriousness of this particular issue , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the <unk> is the <unk> heart of our global <unk> .
she grows in the winter and the summer in summer .
so the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> , which is happening in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is with red .
as you can see , it grows on the <unk> . this is the annual ice of ice in winter ; and it was in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming is the frozen reason to <unk> the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of carbon dioxide , which is when it gets <unk> , from microbes in methane .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> products in the atmosphere , it could double that amount , if we pass this critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska , methane from itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter in the university of the university in alaska is another group of another <unk> lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be <unk> .
and one reason is , this enormous heat is blown greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes up by <unk> , it &apos;s rising in the sea .
these rivers are taking very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , the antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , scientists reported the entire continent now has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that took over a few <unk> , is particularly strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see new lakes , which was a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people on the world will get half of their <unk> .
in the <unk> , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have <unk> .
but if you <unk> , it &apos;s also going to be the most drinking water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the sierra <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions of how you read them are seriously .
this <unk> in the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the world around the world have been really <unk> in the world , and they &apos;ve never got <unk> extent .
four times so many in the last 30 years , as many of the last 30 years .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what &apos;s going on .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent western and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a huge decline of oxygen in the oceans .
the largest factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is that burn from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and charcoal is the endangered biggest issue .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here &apos;s the ones that were made in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have been spent a <unk> dollar last <unk> to promote clean charcoal , which is already a contradiction .
this image remembered me .
for christmas , at home at home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the <unk> of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the ads of the <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
and there &apos;s it in skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will be clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the leader of <unk> <unk> .
let me say one very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so , the alliance of democracy has been called two .
this is one , part of you .
we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it up to the top <unk> , which is a major <unk> to spend a <unk> on the way to get a <unk> on the way to make the truth of charcoal .
in fact , charcoal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean -- and it smells still well .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
leave that quiet .
<unk> charcoal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet , that burn from the main reasons of the world &apos;s most important for global warming is the remarkable clean <unk> that you can see here .
look at it right now , this is the clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all connects these together is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work , to make us safer and help the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out .
this is the last thing .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels that are <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to do well paid jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we have to get far and fast .
thank you .
so i want to ask you to ask you to ask you , at the time of their childhood , when she played with <unk> .
while they realized how to slow down the hands , and <unk> , the <unk> , and moved , they actually learned to think about and problems through understanding and change <unk> experiments .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our surroundings .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> , and my colleagues <unk> , and my colleague <unk> <unk> , i began to wonder : what if we could use computers , which is , if we could use computers , which could be , if we could take computers to do it ?
so this question was so <unk> that we decided to investigate the answer and developed <unk> .
briefly , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can be moved with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your motions , and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : are physically physically , why you can just put them out through the hands of hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are <unk> , and the awareness of your motions are developing , and you can see each other , and you can see the side of our <unk> with them , and then we can start to start with research new and <unk> .
i start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> , and when i <unk> it into a direction , the video is going to go forward , and when i <unk> it into the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so , when i put them together , it &apos;s your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you notice that , and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling your motions and propensity .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we &apos;ve got to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , such as colors as you can do this .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to put color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to be placed .
if we zoom in it , we can get a little <unk> .
there are also a few nice ways in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci number that i make with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
so , you can get every round round of the <unk> , and as you try to make words , and as you try to form words , this is a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s going again , and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are a few kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and take a video .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you must say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another few people who test it .
that &apos;s our youngest <unk> on the bottom right .
it turns out he wanted to share the <unk> .
so for him , they were only <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> .
he can bring new characters in the scene by putting the <unk> from the table , which shows this character .
here he does the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he gets a tractor in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work ! yeah !
when he shake up the <unk> , and she can put the characters together .
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with his end , and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
so , the last example , i &apos;ve got time today to show it is a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve evolved recently , and in the <unk> as sounds like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can choose that you want to use .
and you can <unk> this sound into the sequence that you can put in any patterns .
and you put them to you by just taking a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you put it with a certain sound , and it tends to put it up .
and then there &apos;s a wider effects like the pace of the pace and volume that we &apos;re doing on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start where we put the <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , and this one in a row , put it into a row , and then add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something on this one .
and now i put the filters with the drums , so i can control this effect .
i can accelerate the whole sequence , and i can accelerate the pace into one or other direction .
and now i put the filters with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s happening .
so i don &apos;t have to do it in the process , but it can improvise ; they &apos;re going to increase it .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by looking at the <unk> .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which fit better to how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the ways we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way is that we want to give you the door to this new generation of <unk> with digital media with digital media , which are the information in our world that are our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m delighted to talk to you all !
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m delighted to be there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i just have to go back a little bit , and that &apos;s a little bit about modern biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been doing this for a few years ago , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing , because i just wanted to know about that , and it was very much about what i learned in the study of thinking .
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was an curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
i think most of biology in general are now talking to biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so forth .
extremely important , it &apos;s extremely important , and even more , much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so many things like this whole has changed plants on the <unk> .
now there are craig venter in the <unk> that tries to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
there &apos;s also things that there are things that are completely aware of in the everyday life , which is not aware of most people , for example , that allow us to wash with 40 degrees laundry , are also creating <unk> enzymes .
and the list of the list can continue .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to go on this technology .
so what do you know ?
most people know most people know this from the <unk> .
and then it &apos;s <unk> , and then it &apos;s going to be like this , yes , the hackers break up somewhere , and claws and so forth .
that &apos;s kind of a very sad thing for the <unk> very sad , because it doesn &apos;t matter what they actually started , and what &apos;s actually about it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and that &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a <unk> , and you can &apos;t be able to get a <unk> , and how can you make it better , or how to make it better .
and it &apos;s got it to work with software , but there &apos;s also there in <unk> , there &apos;s also a lot of <unk> that are doing with <unk> all kinds of things .
and now , you know , in biology , and i want this metaphor , which is actually coming out of synthetic biology , suppose that biology is actually a <unk> code , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , it &apos;s real matter .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can do it , you know , you know , you know , and that &apos;s what i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
that &apos;s actually just <unk> eight of this shape , these these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with an cooperation in india in india , which is now members or active people around the world .
so this is a more artist , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and philosophers and working in collaboration with these technologies , with these technologies and to ask questions and ask questions and ask questions , there &apos;s all possible .
but it &apos;s actually about that to find a <unk> access to have a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is a network that &apos;s a network , which is actually a kind of forum where where you take yourself and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of <unk> on the road , then you &apos;re going to ask some <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that have done the whole popular , it &apos;s a scene that i &apos;d like to go back to a minute .
here &apos;s the image on the left on the left on the upper left , which is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , so a private school , nonprofit group , where everybody can be able to get .
children , old , all kinds of people go there to go through it , and they have a laboratory in a lab , and look at what can you do when those <unk> .
here &apos;s a group of indonesia on the left is a group in indonesia , <unk> , which is there &apos;s pretty long .
more than these other two networks .
in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , <unk> , and combine that in a very <unk> way .
a group of november i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a <unk> , who would like to convey to the public , who would like to convey more to the public what you &apos;re learning in university , and they tried to explain people , which is <unk> .
and i put up on the other image in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in a combination of the issue .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s mostly a very young people , but the only thing , which is what &apos;s actually all together , this fascination is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with that , and they &apos;re also <unk> in the society to ask you and ask questions , like this , okay , what do you want to participate , have your interest in doing this ?
so , <unk> , to cut biology , you need some material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and that &apos;s then a laboratory .
or what you normally understand under a lab is so kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , very expensive , very expensive , trained academics with <unk> and so forth .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that doesn &apos;t have to do that .
that &apos;s actually not necessary , because every one of every <unk> has actually got higher technology than most <unk> , which is really so .
and it &apos;s an example of this premise with this premise , and then , for example , brian <unk> in england is trying to have a <unk> <unk> , and then they took a <unk> , a <unk> and , yes , it &apos;s a <unk> , and then it turns bacteria .
so every one , which is already a soup that he has left too long , even before .
i &apos;ve tried that in my lab in my lab , and i put it a little bit , and then she bought me so <unk> on ebay , and a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to go back to the home .
that &apos;s actually not a joke now , but .
here in the bottom , you see the lab in <unk> , so this is a <unk> garage , so this is a <unk> garage with so much kind of <unk> , which has in the middle of a group in paris , which is a group in paris , which is what in fact i want to do a project .
and this is <unk> , which is also called <unk> , that yes , this kind of <unk> in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you can see it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to do it in home , to get it home , to a lot of larger organizations , which is going to do it already in <unk> form .
but always the way that the approach is that it &apos;s easy to be accessible and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve made as international group , when we were actually aware of our self , <unk> , and there &apos;s now a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re going online , and we know the people who are always talking about .
and then it came from the <unk> <unk> version of the founders , and it &apos;s called <unk> , we &apos;ve got to be able to make us real , and then have two events organized , one in london , <unk> 10 , and a little bit in london .
and so , there &apos;s also that , that &apos;s why , yes , <unk> , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say what ?
and what are our values , and what are our economics , our basis ?
and there we have a <unk> <unk> .
that was really intuitive , so everybody &apos;s just so his wishes , his and what it takes him to hold it , then then , then .
there was , my opinion , a very good code .
and then we &apos;re not able to do it , but that &apos;s yeah , i think it &apos;s relatively good , and people are quite convinced by that .
and then we &apos;ve actually tried to do that in the academic world , but there &apos;s kind of a way of it .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> in the way , even a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what do we do now do this ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted a so-called optical case or optical <unk> .
that &apos;s when you focus a laser laser on one in the room , then you can get small particles in the air or in the liquid and then moving into this focus , so that &apos;s where you &apos;ve caught up there , so it &apos;s a <unk> in principle .
it really works , which is made in academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , we might also get a webcam , and then you take a webcam , the lens , the lens , the lens , you know , you have a microscope .
that &apos;s what you see here .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then the <unk> of the laser <unk> and then tries to focus on this camera .
and it didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve got a lot of learning .
so another project that comes from the french group here from the french group of paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s like this , so this is a <unk> , so <unk> , or so something , so he was busy working with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this helmet there , and in the cooperation with the museum with the museum .
and then the visitors could go in the room to go on this chair , put this helmet .
and then they were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states in the united states , which has to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , <unk> , fragments that you can make it visible .
so , if i do that , i &apos;m going to do this in the crime scene , go down , collect any <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to turn this way on , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to that people .
and the machines that do something like that , they &apos;re pretty expensive so that you buy commercial , the cheapest , they &apos;re going to go on <unk> euros .
and that &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just a application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got this two <unk> <unk> , and i said , <unk> , that &apos;s how we make easier and cheap , and then we &apos;ve got out of open source , so that this device is <unk> , and they &apos;re now , in fact , that this device is <unk> , and now that &apos;s the cheapest one of these devices worldwide .
i think kind of six dollars or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in any case in a framework , where it &apos;s clear .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
a project that i &apos;ve got recently was to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , that &apos;s about so far , two centimeter or so .
you get <unk> <unk> on <unk> , and then they put it into these <unk> , and then i put it up on <unk> , and then they put it up with it .
so the device you see here is not working .
but this is so my prototype , but it looked pretty <unk> , so on a branch , so on a branch , the thing on it , electronics , and that was the pressure , and that was the pressure was broken .
and then i took a <unk> , and i put it together .
a <unk> , if you do that full of water , has the enough pressure , so i believe , like 40 to <unk> bar .
and so you can then accelerate the particles strong enough , and then they go into the outside .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros or something like this , <unk> .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially that it &apos;s possible .
so , it &apos;s the point in the moment , that &apos;s also the <unk> of the scene to increase this availability of technology , and also increase the information and <unk> that more people can get there .
because , in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you &apos;re just reading about it , it &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or saw it again .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be a <unk> citizens as a <unk> citizens in society , you can want to meet and go to your own , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and you have to understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> of the <unk> open <unk> and citizen science .
so , as citizens , you &apos;re going to be able to put up with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who actually put at least in the website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s already a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re now protected in asia .
that &apos;s what i believe is there are less people , as in fact .
so i know about some of you who don &apos;t have .
and that &apos;s just the <unk> , the individual people .
in fact , with these <unk> , these places together .
and that &apos;s the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has just begun .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and that &apos;s now a gigantic network of a very good network of very good , yes , <unk> , which are already protected around the world .
and we &apos;re hoping , of course , that we &apos;re going to hold up , and then we &apos;re also similar to expand , and then they &apos;re similar to it , so you can &apos;t be able to be able to be involved .
and i would invite everybody to look at it , and even again , what to try .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and enough energy , you get there too far .
thank you for listening .
that was .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that was really moving me as a designer , but also in the field of <unk> , and in front of all the things in the field of <unk> .
there &apos;s how you &apos;ve seen people in interactive media , so they can use these interactive media , and so they can produce a very <unk> experience .
so , i think the interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models , so that is the paradigm that has been <unk> in our biological memory , and that we &apos;ve just been <unk> through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this <unk> , which is that you &apos;ve actually got one in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is exactly about us , in our <unk> roots .
now , what are now <unk> models ?
i wrote four <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain to you .
in fact , cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the other time we have .
so to these <unk> models , we &apos;ve heard a fundamentally natural relationship with virtuality .
that sounds basically unusual .
and i &apos;m going to go back to the same time , and i &apos;m going to prove you to try to prove you to be a natural relationship with virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve actually been able to talk about this <unk> models , in fact , are very , to speak very , very much , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains itself from itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition <unk> , which is the denial of linearity , and what we &apos;re saying is that we feel what &apos;s normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place for us .
how is this with the virtuality , which is actually the most common thing in the world .
i want to prove you that .
how many doors has the house that they live in ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be able to answer to you immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through this house through this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what you do .
it &apos;s the reality of reality , and it &apos;s a lot of computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there we give us hard to make the virtual reality in our brain system , and we can actually make it all the time .
and this one of the wealth that the virtual reality is to <unk> the reality , the people have needed to be <unk> , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
they had no media media .
the only thing that they had was her head .
and in this head , it was a memory .
in this head , you know , <unk> , and with this virtual images , the imagination , they have been passed on .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can handle it as well .
the interesting thing about this is when i can get a little trip .
yeah , that goes .
the interesting thing about that is that at the time of the person at the same time , <unk> and medium itself .
now , if you think a little bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s given a change .
but that &apos;s what i get to talk about again .
the central tool of the <unk> have been over to have stories .
<unk> , priest , called <unk> , were extra <unk> to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong about stories .
the author of the book is the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re still <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means a kid that has spent the most of the most of the time of the most <unk> most of his life of his life .
now we &apos;re thinking , our love to stories depends that we sit as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far .
that &apos;s a lot further to go back to the cultures of the time .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as particularly amazing is that we have a <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
so , i &apos;ve brought you an example of the north american tribe .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate from sea island to the island to raise food .
and that &apos;s what we call this called <unk> .
you might know that if you &apos;re interested in a little bit about the australian person .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they used to be used so <unk> , or also <unk> .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the <unk> and the topography of regions could be taken by songs .
where the language of the language was <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , and that &apos;s also allowed to be able to <unk> these songs , and then sit together , and they could go back to the left and go back to the left .
why are we not going to sing up from top to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
this is what happens is this <unk> machine machine .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> in the same time .
this is going on machine , and happens is the book , and what happens is this is the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories , and that has changed the production of our individual memories on external media .
on the book and the image .
so , unfortunately , god have a piece of <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly <unk> for us , and it has nothing to do anything else .
bruce brown , a known <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , is so far to say that these media media , he says the book and the image , so it &apos;s not television and so forth , what we &apos;re talking about as media , and our ability to <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
the <unk> for <unk> .
what does an impact on our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then , the <unk> effects of the other cultures are cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more <unk> in the course of the centuries and more <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
that means , instead of remember , we have specific , far common , in mass common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more self .
we have an abstract language .
so we don &apos;t think of the thing that we don &apos;t think more in images that things don &apos;t have more in images , but we <unk> them .
we &apos;ve got used to things that things happen .
and we &apos;ve got the incident as law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s stuck is the <unk> .
still , we are the <unk> as a <unk> very , very closely arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age machine , and we &apos;re going to take this called <unk> .
that sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very after science , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> , which will bring us to find these kinds back to our skills .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to tell you a little bit a little bit .
there are technical concepts like this <unk> reality , which is called reality .
so if you look at google <unk> for example , then this is a concept of what we can combine the virtual world with the real world in the real world , which is the virtual world , which is virtual than something normal , is going to be done again .
another example is called virtual reality .
so , of course , this may be the context of my talk , because we don &apos;t move ourselves into <unk> , virtual worlds , very much after the role model .
and other other example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can react to people .
so , all this needs the ability to accept it as a real habitat .
i &apos;m in the degree , and i hope , the video works , a very , very nice project , that &apos;s a very , very nice project , that &apos;s the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you get up for a minute , you know , you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have the project .
and this project , i have brought to this project as an example of doing this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i must say .
which is extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i go to the computer game , you &apos;re very likely to see any people in front of people who have some people who play some people in the hand , or they play with any <unk> in your hand .
in fact , they &apos;re doing it in there .
that &apos;s a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what they thought i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , which we produce , with the real world .
and i apologize that i must have so strong .
so you can explain it a lot better , there &apos;s more much more .
and that &apos;s why i discover a city by looking at what &apos;s positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get out of the city in a very different view , a very different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city and get a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we might like to look at .
ah , what you can see here is a little explanation of what you &apos;re going to see .
of course , this virtual world is in the walls of our cities .
and with a way , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to tell you my talk my talk , and in the sense , that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve had to have acquired out of the <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , and that we can actually come back to our roots , and that we can actually come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to get to you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be asked if this bag is a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to my instead .
that &apos;s not going to do .
i &apos;m also going to go back in the same thing , which is inside .
but i &apos;m not going to do it again &apos; n .
yes , kids are curious from nature , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m <unk> from the house , so i &apos;m also working with the issue of curiosity and how the curiosity also change our thinking , and why are we going to lose curiosity , and why are we going to go again and so forth .
that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re going to be able to get yourself to the real place as a design .
if professors will be curious , they &apos;re often going to <unk> in the n .
and that &apos;s also what i had last half a year .
it &apos;s a <unk> for natural design interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask questions , why are the whole technique that are doing so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so forth .
and there &apos;s just one of these little devices , because the things are supposed to be more intuitive , always natural , <unk> , and there you have to look at what &apos;s actually <unk> for us , which is <unk> or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve got a natural interface of design design , so the next generation of the human computers , in which , in the relationship of the human computer , in the relationship of the human computer , to be able to change our tools or how the computers changed the computer .
so i &apos;m busy doing this , of course , is , of course or intuitive .
maybe a look at it again .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a moment , then we &apos;re moving from the third in the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern in the <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> through the language .
that means that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other is in the same cave , or in other areas , cities and villages and villages and villages , and in fact , <unk> .
but it was the language , but it was something very different , something very living .
so you had to learn it , so you don &apos;t know how to talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , and we &apos;re learning it , of course .
and then that became a way of the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a <unk> , because of course , the living language began to <unk> language in the form of script , which is what <unk> and alive is , let me start to start and <unk> it in rock .
and depending on how i &apos;m <unk> and when i &apos;m <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story than if there &apos;s a way of living .
but then <unk> then moved to the script as a <unk> , got up .
then the next generation came in which we &apos;re actually living today .
that &apos;s the <unk> and <unk> <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was just a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and others have said , are you really <unk> , if the people want to read , then they want to be <unk> , and that &apos;s actually totally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re coming into the next generation , and the exciting thing is that a <unk> is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this <unk> phase , that we &apos;re going to be involved .
so , of course , the confused of , of course , because we see the new media , social social media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , you know , the old thinking , you don &apos;t say that in the <unk> <unk> , and no beef is more or other phenomena , which i want to do is just <unk> that .
and these two worlds just turn together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this new society , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but it &apos;s not more on the local level , but in a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that &apos;s the story ecology is a global .
not if i think there &apos;s a local law and your neighbor thinks less green , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village , is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , more intuitive intuitive , but also the total transparency .
as you knew in the village in the village , who was what happens to whom and when , this is what happens today about this extension of our self through this <unk> in the global level .
is it , we know globally , and faster and better and better .
this was how it happened to the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been busy to see what does it mean for us , of course , what we might also have <unk> , what does the difference for us ?
because often you get people , you can &apos;t make it <unk> , so you can &apos;t deal with it .
so you &apos;ve got to deal with that , which means that , and not just to change it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and when is , of course , it &apos;s something intuitive , and how can i take an impact as a designer , and it turns out to the things that you &apos;re doing a <unk> , so you &apos;re more intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun , and then they &apos;re easy to use .
so you &apos;ve been trained , even during the student , with the theme of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , of course , where you start and look at it and says , okay , i &apos;m just looking at the inside itself .
and how does it look at it ?
so how do we work when we <unk> ?
and what does it mean is , of course , intuitive , how do we work our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process does ?
because steve jobs have told you to make you <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to do something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which is called the core .
and you &apos;ve already seen that you &apos;re a seven senses , most of the people we think are only five , it &apos;s already seven , because i &apos;m sure in the near future in the near future , and as an extension of our self .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of using the word , but don &apos;t know what it does all the detail .
but i &apos;ve got to understand in the core , where is going to understand information , when you know information is going to know information , and from information , i know how to make things even more intuitive , or of course .
and of course , how does design change on perception .
we see this , when i do things , i can make it confusing up on the right side , where i don &apos;t know , what is salt and pepper , or i can make things kind of intuitive , i &apos;m going to show things .
so , very much natural , it &apos;s in a plate , but i look straight , where is salt and pepper .
and if i say somebody , you give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to think about where it &apos;s in there .
and then the left simple intuitive access to me and then hopefully i hope that no sugar is in there to give the salt .
but also our perception itself , how does they make us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and yet our perception is how context we &apos;re doing things .
anybody knows what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work again .
there &apos;s a little bit more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle begins to put some similarity or associate .
and if i &apos;m going to take a <unk> <unk> , then we don &apos;t just look at one unit , which is a circle , a circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a different .
that &apos;s what you call <unk> or <unk> , which is also influenced by perception .
it &apos;s important for the design , which is most of the most semester in the first semester .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> the continuity and so forth .
so often in third , you &apos;ve forgotten .
but this is an essential important ingredient , if you want things to be able to do things as well as well as well .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is this .
it sounds quite banal , but it &apos;s how exciting as you go closer to it .
so we &apos;ve got the eyes on the front , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the beginning .
that &apos;s wrong .
you look at the back of the back .
and it &apos;s a case of <unk> an assumption , and you can see something that you recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we &apos;re just going to look at <unk> , before we can see it back to the back of our <unk> <unk> to say , okay , okay .
i &apos;ve got cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got a cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what <unk> you want .
that &apos;s also there , it &apos;s coming back again .
then it goes back to the front of the front , because the back of the back is not going to look at the front of the front and says , right now , i &apos;m going to go back again and feel if you can see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , a very , very <unk> process , like certain things , and what happens to do this stuff .
i don &apos;t know who has this image .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who can see .
does somebody see something ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s a <unk> inside , you know that .
you will never forget , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , you see it always .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve actually been doing is that you &apos;re actually talking about no patterns that you don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i &apos;ve always been able to see it in a very short time to see this dog in this <unk> image .
and this is this projection of vision , <unk> , see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go back to the beginning that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so very , very exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray , you don &apos;t actually do , but here in this <unk> mass of the mass .
anybody knows what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i go out of the present in the present , i can also bridge very well <unk> , which i &apos;m doing it by three seconds .
it &apos;s only to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can learn very elegantly <unk> for example at the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you &apos;re in love .
that means you know , if you know this , you look at who you look like long because i don &apos;t have a <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of the most perceptions we have .
that means this is what happens in a quick quick pace of how we perceive things .
and as we can see things also , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we can go against our environment , so we can think of that .
of course , it &apos;s not just related to the issue of perceptions and neural <unk> , or <unk> , but in fact , with the issue of <unk> .
so , how is a person with certain things .
there &apos;s a practical functions , which is so <unk> things or <unk> things .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i know exactly where i &apos;m actually going to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why gives you a little bit of <unk> , which gives you a little bit of <unk> , where don &apos;t you know what <unk> , so <unk> money on money , although it &apos;s not so practical ?
there we are more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , where we &apos;re also thinking of , of course .
back to my real issue , natural interface and the issue , which is also <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> is always saying , how can i get to a certain goal , or how to make a users in a certain process of capable , more effective , efficient and <unk> .
so it &apos;s more likely to say the norm .
how can i do something more likely ?
can i do that right , or i need to make &quot; n , or need to be a <unk> training .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i &apos;m just doing that , and i &apos;m doing beautiful , not that it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand .
and if you have a part of the software that we &apos;ve seen in the software that we &apos;ve seen , and then you &apos;ll understand why <unk> percent of our today is slightly intuitive or not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be more intuitive , which is actually more intuitive than classic software .
and it &apos;s not only <unk> <unk> , not only since apple <unk> a bit of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if i want to be able to be able to make technology .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re through this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user <unk> , for example , five times faster at the average of our goal .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you make some of the classic <unk> , five hours , and with this new way of natural software , only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably be able to go home four hours more to home , but your collaborator , or anybody , you can see it with four hours .
but i want to say , of course , for us , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , also certain things .
if we &apos;re going to go back to the field of the software , here &apos;s the first <unk> line that were very abstract , which was very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that &apos;s already got to be a <unk> model or a mental model like the software <unk> , and you have worked up , you know , you have a sense of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computers be useful .
so not more zeros and ones or <unk> code , it &apos;s a metaphor .
that was a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing as a design very much more likely to do the behavior than this .
that &apos;s also a paradigm paradigm .
that i &apos;m going to look like this is always <unk> for success , just to be a app .
and if i &apos;m going to take a step <unk> in these natural user interfaces , where i was in a voice , by language , by language , by the gesture , and you don &apos;t have to control the things , then i &apos;m still faster and another one .
but that &apos;s also going back to the point again , when they &apos;re going to be more intuitive ?
if you get more intuitive , and then i have to get back my little friend here , and you look at what does that mean from view of the <unk> , when it &apos;s really intuitive to be intuitive ?
and this is always a little bit intuitive , if i have to think very little about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think , but it &apos;s easy to do it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
so , if we look at that we can see existing <unk> from one on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do it as a design .
that means i can just put a intuitive , human <unk> on a software , and to make the software much more <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , of course , what &apos;s actually the <unk> <unk> of us , and now i &apos;ve got it .
this is called <unk> .
that &apos;s all of us and <unk> is an acronym , and it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s all of you all of you all the time , but he &apos;s doing it , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly , instinctively .
the model is going to be <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in the world with young and old , and it &apos;s used for us to use all the time , without that most , that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> times from us from the activity of activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve realized that there will be less <unk> than a day .
now , i can have this mental <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m doing this , for example , in which i &apos;m taking them as a <unk> , <unk> as a choice , you know , in the case , it &apos;s big to me , i can look at it in the detail , and i can see it in the detail , and you can go or buy it and so forth .
then i can transmit this whole .
i &apos;m trying to go through a <unk> .
you &apos;ve got pies every already .
so , you know , i kind of look at the object with the object , can <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview of this , can now filter this , and you can tell me all of you with chocolate for chocolate .
and once you have a interface , which is much more intuitive and very much natural natural .
because that i can reach the things like this piece , <unk> , and they come to me , is much more natural than if you &apos;re talking about <unk> organized websites or other ways to make these things accessible .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i want to close to one , i want to close to one and give the evidence , also , designers have to think differently in new solutions , and in this sense , i thank you right for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you become a child , as a baby , is that you care about what &apos;s going to do , you know what <unk> you have to do , yes ? and depending on how your parents could have allowed you to play more or less , and the more , they &apos;re going to be , of course , is going to be , of course .
and the curiosity can &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why everybody who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
so i &apos;m doing this , basically this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day you give them , they &apos;re going to be about two gram of phosphorus and every day you have to take two gram phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t actually take phosphorus and make phosphorus .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re doing something like this , which is actually a <unk> , but not that .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
it &apos;s much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only been phosphorus for two years , and now we &apos;re now going to have a lot of uranium in the world &apos;s much more uranium into the environment as in all <unk> .
in the last twenty years alone , <unk> tons of uranium on our fields are distributed in germany .
and we take it all on .
it makes leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , it &apos;s less car .
<unk> the environment , make less garbage .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i say , <unk> your kid , blow it just three times rather than five .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about this from the <unk> to <unk> , then our entire earth is going to be used or later a <unk> .
to think about the <unk> to think about <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent is stored .
at the moment we &apos;re building corn and lose between 11 and 30 pounds of 30 tons per hectare , or on the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing about five five times more than new educated .
so , of course , we can see the <unk> .
and everything is yes or content .
in <unk> , for example , in <unk> , twenty percent of the <unk> .
and because we will be older , it will be bigger .
that &apos;s you all in the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby takes about six thousand <unk> .
we could use that for 10 percent , but what does it do ?
that will be balanced in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the way that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be <unk> in the <unk> components .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what that is , right ?
well , traditionally , we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you have the people who exist when you &apos;re saying it &apos;s better , if you say it would be better , you &apos;re not , you know , they &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so somebody like al gore , one of our big heroes , there is nothing more <unk> than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you <unk> a lot of people , you <unk> the earth .
here it says , you know , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then when the ants weigh about four times more than we .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one may not see termites in that way , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we do , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re doing something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re stupid , yes ?
and where you can see how far we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to reach and could , and how sad we are on earth , you can see that , for example , a program has a program , until twenty 40 , you want to be here .
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yeah ?
the only chance .
did you have seen a <unk> tree ?
yeah ?
one one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be a trees as trees , yes ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
fortunately , yes ?
there is no <unk> on trees .
there &apos;s still six billion trees alone .
you &apos;ve already heard something about <unk> ?
that means , all of our intelligence means that we want to be a trees as trees .
and where you can see , even in something like this , the <unk> <unk> , is not allowed to go back to our own <unk> .
every year we &apos;re losing that three million tons of phosphorus that really must go back .
and so we &apos;re too many .
it alone .
this is what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you all hot that allow our own <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to make sense of being less harmful , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it goes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing it in brazil in where we get the nutrients back .
so , right , we can <unk> nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re going to take straight to them .
in china , this is a <unk> <unk> today , sort of , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the whole western <unk> comes from that the city has always been taken , but the farmers never got something .
so the cities had to grow more , because the farmers went into the cities , and the cities had to go further away their nutrients .
all of the western rich are always expanding , until they couldn &apos;t have done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five hours , because you &apos;ve always been able to <unk> nutrients .
even today , if you were invited to eat in china , you would expect to eat as long until they &apos;re looking at the bathroom .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat it , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see the internet , you can see how to walk the nutrients .
that &apos;s really nice about that , if you do that , so agriculture is doing , so it generates , on a hectare of country with five hours in favelas , so a farmer can have about <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be waiting for a farmer and <unk> and the pig and the fish .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the favelas are around over <unk> percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be much bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , <unk> , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by design , which is a farmer , it &apos;s easy .
that means to go back to the <unk> .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over <unk> in the last twenty years , not from those facilities , ever <unk> .
you could just get a gallons of <unk> <unk> , and then it would be ruins over years .
not instead .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people to be much bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we must have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you know , in germany , on the best recovery of all the services , is that in <unk> .
unfortunately , that &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can make it a little bit like this .
because the <unk> plant could be the best thing to take the phosphorus back .
and that must go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s going to do .
we &apos;ve used to be used for three years now .
the dutch government tells you , they &apos;re going to be the first country worldwide , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need this one .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> .
there is the opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to replace the oil from different energy .
but the phosphorus will not replace .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s not about doing it a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and it &apos;s particularly asking questions , which is the right thing .
that means it &apos;s efficiency , not for efficiency .
in holland , you know , it &apos;s easier , of course , because in holland is the land on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if you have <unk> them , and they come up with 50 .
completely inefficient .
but very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eats about six pounds of life during your life .
this .
this is scientific not right , because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to happen .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you is completely inefficient , but very effective , yes ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
so to ask , what is the right ?
not to burn a little bit better and burn it , and to lose it , and to lose all the materials that are losing all the materials , but first to ask questions , how do you bring the senses ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yeah ?
if i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , &apos; one ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love in love , efficient ?
yeah ?
that means all what counts in life is not to save it to reduce .
all the <unk> .
we say the people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have any right in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , yes ?
in every place , where you &apos;re <unk> , yes , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in how we think from north .
there is every footprint there .
if you walk , yes , every footprint of the ground .
because the ground is going to die , and the wind and the wind and the water is washing the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water will stand longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not save , avoid , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a kind of like if you see in italy , like the people in italy , like the people in the high bow , that &apos;s a coke pepsi .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve evolved a <unk> , which is a liquid fluid .
you can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours they &apos;re building around .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re going to make biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two <unk> .
not anything to be <unk> .
a television or a washing washing machine , you only use you don &apos;t use it .
just the things that <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who have to be so that they go into biological systems .
the things that are used to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
very direct ads , and it &apos;s not for the company <unk> , but it &apos;s not for the company of <unk> , but it &apos;s now helping this business to help these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
yeah ?
so , if i say it &apos;s <unk> and say , this is free from <unk> , then you don &apos;t help them .
no , we put it inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic inside .
but everything is in there , is useful .
that &apos;s the first shoes that you can see the <unk> on the <unk> , and the rubber in biological nanotubes can go , yes ?
all of it is <unk> .
and if we can do it , of course , it &apos;s about <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole industry .
and that &apos;s half of all <unk> worldwide that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing with , ask questions for people .
hey , <unk> , is you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve already changed the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really <unk> .
so , help me take a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
that goes .
so we can do the things that you can do , if you &apos;re <unk> , if you <unk> , you can see it in biological .
technical , there &apos;s the same thing .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> .
this is the first ecological backpack , in fact , that &apos;s done to go into the circle .
so that , in every store , you can <unk> things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
if the moment is the garbage .
all over all , this is <unk> , nearly .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the same thing on the <unk> , but also in the landscape ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside that they can go back to <unk> , then you can put them in israel or in tunisia , trees .
yeah ?
if you take these these <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , it and the powder to plant trees .
that &apos;s the baby <unk> for the whole life , already from beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i &apos;ve started a institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and you can all get together .
there &apos;s extra a group of a group , <unk> , where everybody can join .
so don &apos;t save more saving , avoid , avoid , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you wonder the curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my talk to my talk , i was written as a <unk> , and i &apos;m a <unk> , so in the english <unk> , understand .
<unk> is an hour of the written grades in <unk> music .
you don &apos;t just be a translator for the word of the text in a different language , but also , the deeper sense of the words and <unk> to understand it &apos;s a good translation , everybody who has to do with <unk> .
to translate out of the germans in the english , you can do more knowledge , because if you go to poetry , or to poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien for <unk> , which is what we do with the musicians with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i &apos;ve just got the written grades .
you think that the composer in the notes is exactly all <unk> , which he was seeing .
in fact , the grades are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about just as just as much or <unk> , like a comfort , if you seem to be very <unk> accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not able to smell the level of the <unk> , the degree of the <unk> , is not to hear the <unk> of the <unk> .
that means that the role has to take this <unk> data of the <unk> in a different , which is <unk> to be unique , nonverbals .
today , i &apos;m going to want to tell you what i &apos;m going to be able to translate forever , so <unk> , even in a personal language .
so a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to do it to do it on german , because if i had to translate it again in english , it would be <unk> for me to translation .
so the music is working for me as similar to spoken spoken language .
the <unk> grades have the function of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to be able to read just grades and read that to the piano or the right place to the piano .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of the letters you can only see if you can do the language .
so you need to do for the learning process of music at least as much as a spoken language .
so there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , only passive understanding or you can also talk to the music to the music .
the work of the <unk> starts similar to how the one <unk> .
and after all , after all , you &apos;ve chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about this , you &apos;re looking forward to the origin of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from composer itself .
you studied the work that he was looking at , and after that .
you &apos;re comparison .
the <unk> to write it .
how do he mean ?
how were his lives , how the society and politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in me .
you think in this time , if you &apos;re looking at contemporary images , or i read literature .
but at the time , you &apos;ve also got a rich knowledge for the composer of the composer , which you &apos;re going to play once , and it &apos;s always easier to feel in him and feel .
it &apos;s always going to be more to a friend where you live together .
his cause to write this piece is always going to be more and more to my personal cause to play it .
now , there &apos;s all other than an accurate record of the composer of the composer , but it &apos;s just a scaffold , and i turn this scaffold to turn it back to meaning and meaning .
i &apos;ll say with my own words , which could be written between this scaffold .
i &apos;m playing <unk> , what these sounds might mean .
now for me , and for the composer , and what they might mean for him today .
every tone , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it yourself , because it comes out of my personal <unk> .
it has to be <unk> for me in here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience , i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert again , if i can have the experience , the piece of that i &apos;ve got a long time in advance in advance .
as you &apos;ve always met a happy new day , even though the same rituals of life , stand up , stand up to work , get up to work , and i &apos;ve always got the same thing to go back to new .
i &apos;ve become a day older , and i &apos;ve become older , and my pulse goes down at night as a morning , it takes the sound back back to your home .
i take the breathe true , you know , or <unk> .
all that affects me and all that affects my experience with composition .
well , if i stand with a <unk> on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and then this answer is a reaction with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things are happening we don &apos;t have <unk> , and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s great fun to make music , and they &apos;ve experienced when the audience is communicating alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like that moment .
i can &apos;t play that in twenty years today .
here i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to do a lot more <unk> , and emotions and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have new <unk> .
i have a nice concrete example .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> at my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a known <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of the <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so it was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great luck , it was very early at 13 years old , and so i was to meet my school in my school classes .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> is to me .
that &apos;s a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
there he , and he said , this ?
that must be the <unk> .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , at 17 , you &apos;ve just got dreams , but no major memories .
i &apos;ll play this piece of a few years today , and it always has changed for me , even though it &apos;s not changed .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because again i read something new .
one example of this is a very different area , which has made the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but too different <unk> , in <unk> light .
he translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as he saw it in this moment .
his personal <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is like this .
now , i &apos;ve also been older as chopin with <unk> years , when he wrote the piece .
he lived only for a <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look back into the grades , even if i do my , you know .
to keep <unk> , directly with the composer .
because the grades are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
well , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about just as much as a spoken language .
often , the <unk> is that you just learn the grades .
you &apos;re learning practical first to read before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the sound to the grades on the instrument .
so if all the fingers , if all the time , as it goes into the notes , then you get the sound , then you get the sounds like music .
if that &apos;s happening , the student gets the <unk> piece .
over interpretation will hardly talk about it .
all right , there is a quick piece , which is a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , r and b , etc .
that &apos;s most of this .
but also , if you take this data , it still still gets something technology .
and yet it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
and i wonder that you often forget something very <unk> .
which is that , to make music on the instrument , to make your musical , and feel to be there before .
that &apos;s what sing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn to sing because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it by itself .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experience , and the idea of music to have to have a more opportunity , so it &apos;s about an instrument to make it .
people who had never been singing , they &apos;ve never felt close to your body , as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
the music music is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the tune from the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make more even music , if it gets bored .
no longer needed to say a <unk> , or sing .
every way your music is going to be <unk> , if you go from the outside of music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i don &apos;t sing it ?
so the question i ask you can &apos;t sing , a because you believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to start trying to figure out if you can &apos;t yet , or learn how to make these little muscles that <unk> the vocal chords .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve <unk> it , they &apos;re <unk> .
so , i ask you , like <unk> , was this diagnosis ?
did you have a <unk> or <unk> , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and i want to have no way to do it .
but what i would have regret , because music is a nice , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can do it again .
so , you know , you don &apos;t have to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say , please , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
there i say , but you can say , you can say if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know whether it tastes me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t eat the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to be rid of classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to you and tell you whether it tastes you or not .
whether the music is too <unk> or cute .
say what you feel .
and with the time , they &apos;re also going to be able to do , and you want something more spices , or taste even fine differences .
why am i going to say from my audience , that it &apos;s going to listen to ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of art you &apos;ve never looked at , has no force .
the food that was <unk> by a chef or a chef as a chef <unk> , and not just looked at recipes .
so you want to hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment , where the adults are going to be active music , or at least active music , a child , and then it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> , to ask questions , what color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the kid play , after a <unk> , rather than a red flower .
and this sounds like before .
that was the first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step is a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written by a hundred , or a hundred year-old years ago ?
now , the instruments have <unk> .
there was time in the time as an instrument , no piano .
it was just not invented .
i think that the stream would have been enthusiastic when he had the <unk> possibility of modern <unk> .
i can have the <unk> that the stream has had been , on the modern wing , to sound what &apos;s not able to do a <unk> .
you know from beethoven , you know that he had gotten more deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is an orchestra from the time as a <unk> .
that &apos;s why the composers depend on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so they will be <unk> , which they &apos;ve just evolved in the spirit .
and also what you would think in the spirit today .
or what i &apos;m doing today is because what they could have thought .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
were you all <unk> ?
and how did that feel like ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
if i come up with my little <unk> w , and i &apos;m going to go back to the point of that feeling .
i cut something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need a big car ?
that &apos;s a half of its value .
and at all , you work much less than i .
why do i have to afford a little car .
and then i &apos;m going to see it immediately .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice is this awkward sense .
our organism has invented a great method to make such feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can try to try to try to say like revenge or <unk> or things .
i want to tell you about this mechanism today , or something you &apos;re going to do something that is not familiar .
the mechanism comes from a lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you might have heard , if people say , no one has to build a wall .
and then <unk> <unk> , so he &apos;s looking at the view .
in a lie , you can see that the liars might not believe what he says .
it &apos;s very easy to check that it &apos;s very different in mind .
it &apos;s just not one of them and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with that , you know yourself .
you need this lie to get a <unk> to get a <unk> down .
you can get less easy , yes , <unk> or also to get down .
you need time .
from this time , an anecdote , you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once has a woman .
this woman has been <unk> , the portrait wouldn &apos;t you see .
picasso says , just wait .
it will always be similar .
at this point , if you laugh , you see how important this lie , and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship with a lie .
the artist shares a little bit , and particularly this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if you just look at the mirror .
the artist shares them in a portrait of something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with , if you look at this piece of art .
and then this awkward feeling goes away , it could not be similar to you , and it will always be similar .
so here they have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not just in the art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology in the mythology .
you may know this idea of the queen who looked at every morning in the mirror , and he asked him , who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and you also know how much hostility from this true one , the mirrors can &apos;t lie out of that true gap .
but we should just be familiar with that that you can &apos;t tell a woman to say that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here we need this , which is what we understand under <unk> <unk> , always .
we need this lie at this point that we need the deception , without that we can &apos;t live .
we &apos;re not just in art , in the <unk> , but also in science that are such great .
and there is this story from the wife of the <unk> of <unk> .
she heard about charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the ancestry of the people .
that man should be <unk> by the monkeys , and , yes , there was a common ancestors between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her man and said , that &apos;s not true what charles there writes .
the person should be <unk> by the monkeys or a common ancestors .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people to get out of them .
why do we need to prevent people from something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these <unk> .
because we do this <unk> , this feeling is great to be great by the highest creature , not from one such creature , not from such a <unk> , from something like this , which is that there &apos;s a rock and whatever things , that is for us .
so , we can &apos;t do this stuff .
we need to stop that people know from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slow this mechanism on , and how to look at the traces that he leaves to take this to something else than on this great image of ourselves , i want you to see another story .
a particularly nice story , as i mean .
my wife has told me .
she came from school , she &apos;s teacher , and she told you about a student .
a <unk> student .
she &apos;s particularly happy to do it , because it has a propensity to each other .
and she asked him , what are your actions ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m on the firemen .
and because i &apos;m at the firemen , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel that if you &apos;re <unk> , you know , there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , always when a man in a moral sense of <unk> , because we should try to replace it through the <unk> while .
do it , and then you know the sentence .
even though i &apos;m on the firemen , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind us .
so a little bit of <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can find out of where you &apos;re learning how to make fire .
there &apos;s just the second second second .
there he came up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t say his teacher , you would like to put fire somewhere , and i &apos;m happy when the fire <unk> .
no , it just looks much better , if we show that we &apos;re in charge that we &apos;re doing for the risks that can only be able to be able to get up to the other .
here you have this little mechanism .
and this is the <unk> that this <unk> has already knew that he was related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious who &apos;s immediately <unk> , without being able to do something about it , and the things that you know are very much better for you and others .
so , just look like these words , which we &apos;re also using in the language of the politically correct speech .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know if we &apos;re talking about that , the social <unk> are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s impossible , such things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
what logic logic is that deception , this <unk> , the willingness , another reality than that we actually know in the unconscious knowledge that it &apos;s because it &apos;s because of the outside .
i want to leave you two , maybe three examples .
for the first example , what many of you are familiar with , and some of you don &apos;t appreciate , very few of them .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something , which is not from stop <unk> , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the most important belief that you have a soul , or you can also say that you can say from the soul to life , and then imagine that the soul had a mental framework on the earth , and they &apos;re just like a mental framework on the earth .
and from this soul , you think it &apos;s kind of in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , which is called it in the latin , which is <unk> .
and if that <unk> then , it &apos;s all <unk> , then it &apos;s filled with it , with mind , with nature , with nature that can only live in the soul .
and then he can get <unk> .
that &apos;s how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from outside to people .
so we &apos;re going to perceive them as something that &apos;s supposed to be present for our life .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky to make this happiness through a lie .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> , you know from school .
this is now a <unk> that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
that &apos;s how to lie that they can just use these logic wrong .
in this <unk> , three sets of sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;re right , he didn &apos;t have soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
so , i &apos;ve been in a very close .
a third sentence that immediately comes up with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
you say , who doesn &apos;t have soul , which is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical .
i can say everything .
the logic does not tell you about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critically , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t have soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now , our <unk> consciousness immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third set of that , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how if the contrary of the first sentence has already proven and once .
because actually we have to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , it &apos;s easy to make two sentences correct , and a third <unk> that looks like that , as he could have to do something that we can save our <unk> .
so , we &apos;re doing this as if it &apos;s impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can keep these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example , which is always going back to the <unk> .
for this , you have to get another <unk> issue , a <unk> from philosophy .
that has to do with that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who was called <unk> <unk> , and after this is the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which is from pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
that &apos;s a <unk> .
and if you put that exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going to go first .
so it &apos;s exactly in the middle .
these are the <unk> .
<unk> forces <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you take another example , you know , if you &apos;re going to get a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and nothing to do it .
automatically , it goes to the right thoughts .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , it will be driven by the bigger pile that &apos;s going to put a immediately immediately , and then they have a little bit quick that there must be a free will .
and if we &apos;re in <unk> here in <unk> , then i remember the <unk> of brain .
there &apos;s a scholars , which is called wolf <unk> , and from him , you sometimes say , wolf <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence , and you can say , if wolf can be right , he didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are completely logical and correct .
and what we can see is to read almost daily in the newspaper , that &apos;s the third sentence .
it looks like that , who doesn &apos;t have <unk> , not for his actions , not for his actions and claims to responsibility , and he &apos;s so <unk> .
here you have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this , as if the first sentence is wrong by the world , as if you think about the opposite of the world without evidence .
and now you can just do that if you want to test yourself , if you want to test yourself , and most importantly , if you want to make people happy to make these courage to lie .
so , for example , if you meet a man , you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is called prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be one , for granted , you know , you know , you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy doing that , you know , you can &apos;t prove that there is no <unk> , it &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled it .
because he led them to a <unk> , that he doesn &apos;t react to it .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in it , and it &apos;s just interested in the need to prove yourself that there are <unk> .
so , in the way of the <unk> , they &apos;re going to experience the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; a lie .
and if you have a chance again , you have a way to feel that <unk> with other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to do other happy if you don &apos;t remember this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i was allowed to ask myself to say if i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and i asked me if i wanted to take a talk , and my idea .
i &apos;ve got to say , honestly , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , and i fell hard to talk about my idea .
and i may think i might imagine my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to introduce you .
but it &apos;s of course , of course , is the sum , quite many ideas .
i probably probably are the two nice girls here , and i &apos;m probably probably part of the generation that has been made for this bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve already started to study designers in <unk> , technical school , which is what i believe .
and i was then in berlin , in berlin , for berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energies , and that &apos;s not <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
that was all <unk> , the <unk> was called <unk> .
this is <unk> today .
because a good engineer has either built a great car or <unk> .
but that &apos;s what <unk> <unk> , from the kind of hundred watts , from the kind of hundred watts , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m the <unk> thankful that he was able to put the word again again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word out , because everything left was bad .
however , this was not so much .
there was the fact that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you thought evil .
but the place of <unk> , but that was <unk> , and it was made wind and solar energy , and i started the mid- &apos; 80s .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been told today is very much , because many , lots of beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve got through .
i worked 11 years in the collective , which was <unk> .
we were twenty people .
if a no one said , it was the <unk> , which has a completely <unk> , and i &apos;ve got a decade for 10 years , i &apos;ve got hard to <unk> if i was doing my great <unk> , you know , you &apos;ve got the money in my father &apos;s window , you &apos;ve got the money in the window .
it &apos;s busy .
and that was really , very , very , very , very <unk> , and then you go into this phase phase in the phase phase , this is a picture on <unk> , where i asked me for 10 years , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the collective , whether that &apos;s really the great thing .
and i was then <unk> , and then we got together with friends , and then we have become the <unk> of the company , and then together with the <unk> <unk> of one of the largest <unk> of the world .
a <unk> , but we &apos;ve also got the problem of a growing company , and we &apos;ve got <unk> , a little group , decided that we &apos;re starting to start and go back to the next issue of the future , and that &apos;s what i mean , it &apos;s going to be the <unk> , and that &apos;s what i mean , it &apos;s not going to talk about .
and i brought you to a project that i want to introduce you now .
and the title of my talk was , you know , is a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking with a relatively <unk> story , where could you make a memory to make a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , these are the data .
there &apos;s a half thousand people .
now , you have a renewables today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just technologically .
if you put more <unk> each other , the system begins to fail .
i always want to tell that the politicians , if you &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
they always say why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our net is actually the european european .
if we had 20 percent , we would have seen the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , the first thing that was <unk> , had the first thing to do with the island , even though it &apos;s just through .
as big , because it &apos;s actually a battery , you know , you know , one island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go again again .
the conventional system sees all over the world .
by the way a year a year , a hundred , electrical performance will <unk> electrical performance on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred power power , because it &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , which is happening is going to be deleted , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you put this box .
and then it looks like this .
that &apos;s always three of the <unk> , two will always waited .
yeah , this is what you see is the load .
we also have very precise data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is also is a <unk> system , or a system , which can only <unk> in small amounts here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> and the wind , and the wind , the sun , the load that they can map the bigger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energies , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn out the little .
that means , in the moment , you have to worry that renewable energies can be able to take the entire net .
so , of course , you can only be , of course , if you &apos;re in any way , in any way .
that has no one on the world .
so that &apos;s in the small style , so you can also have a <unk> in the car in the car .
people always ask me , what do you mean , in <unk> ?
that &apos;s already .
but if you want to be several of these <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s going to build a net , it &apos;s very complicated .
and our goal was that we wanted to get on 70 to <unk> percent renewable , and then there &apos;s another rest , the last one , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re doing it from batteries .
that &apos;s going to be a product of energy , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas gas , you know or <unk> , that will be it .
you &apos;ve got to go on a <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far does you get ?
and then you &apos;ve done a lot of simulation .
and you have wind and the sun and the load of <unk> and came to the result , a very exciting outcome , that you have a very exciting outcome , which takes a middle <unk> of about 50 cents a <unk> , about 50 cents a <unk> .
that was the first calculations for six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we are cheaper like the <unk> , if the <unk> five percent per year goes up .
and then we started playing with the <unk> .
what would be done anything ?
with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time , and we were just five people to build the society .
and again , this representation .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , which is the green system .
that our system also has a <unk> , is that we &apos;re still going to do twenty percent with you , and you can &apos;t make a <unk> on the other stuff on the other stuff .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> on the island , has meant that we find great .
let &apos;s also support support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we actually can actually map the electrical <unk> of the island of one to three .
that means we were looking for the largest battery of the world .
here you are .
that comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , she &apos;s in the &apos; &apos; 70s in the &apos; &apos; 70s , today , and then <unk> , and then they became the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she &apos;s got a megawatts of performance , and it can bring six hours for this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then they did .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he says to the hall in the hall , in fact , the full dynamic behavior of this net , so in the hall , this is the big battery that we &apos;re looking at the net that we &apos;re doing the net .
over this over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cables , to be sort of the <unk> in the net .
and here you can see it again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
here we can see this again again , again , the whole , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done is that since <unk> was done , the hall was done , until today , it &apos;s sort of <unk> everything here between the single system of electronics that we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the battery and the theme of the net , and it &apos;s all in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing is about the issue that you can actually put on this island today , it &apos;s all the way that we &apos;re going to be able to increase when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going to go back to the moment and <unk> , <unk> , like that &apos;s going to go on the island to 30 percent <unk> , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
so , <unk> is going to be <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
so we can start to integrate it on the island to integrate <unk> , <unk> , you can be able to manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at 50 percent renewable , then you &apos;re not going to do that without memory .
you can <unk> by &apos; n , you can do it by <unk> of nets , yes , that &apos;s what you should do , the proportion of <unk> , but you can never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s a little bit like the message .
so many people are coming up and look at it , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn out the <unk> , you don &apos;t have this spinning mass that causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is essentially just rotating masses of <unk> mass of large <unk> , wherever the wave all over europe is like this .
we look at this network , you see 50 hertz , and when it gets <unk> <unk> <unk> nine hertz , we &apos;re going to start a little bit of <unk> <unk> , and then we come up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly clear .
if you <unk> this somewhere , it takes a long time .
the <unk> has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time you can react other other .
if you don &apos;t have that , these galaxy , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can see two milliseconds with this big battery .
you know , you know , there are enormous <unk> there .
and the message is now , we need to get up to this rotating mass , if we sort of use our goals 20 , twenty , twenty percent , 20 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to get that at all .
then we have to break up our <unk> capacity in the net .
<unk> <unk> is easy to hold the frequency .
yes , this is a <unk> at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t know , or <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t go .
and we &apos;ll just try to try to try to get the capacity that can break up the ability to break up to the <unk> , and it can bring the personalized memory into the net .
now there &apos;s also a whole lot of studies .
and to that point , people will always come up and look at our <unk> on the way that we &apos;re like to do our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you make a piece of the future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years , which was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
not , there &apos;s no , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve never known .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to go from that in the next 30 years , that we &apos;re going to have the same capacity in the next 30 years .
just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of <unk> and arguments .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve actually experienced in the last two years now that the scientists go on my side .
now we &apos;ve got to get over 10 million <unk> , also to <unk> the german net .
that &apos;s going to happen in april .
so , you know , you know , there &apos;s a change that there &apos;s a change , and it &apos;s only from that <unk> , and it &apos;s only from that <unk> , to be a hundred percent renewable right .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so , in discussions , they &apos;re always trying to do this <unk> , which is going to do a little little net , which has a own little net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
so the question is very simple , if you &apos;re doing completely independently of any fossil or <unk> <unk> that will be <unk> anywhere in the world and get to them , they &apos;re an island .
then you &apos;re just going to use that , which is where the sun and wind is there where they live .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy , and i &apos;m also thankful that they &apos;ve said to use energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , also the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can be able to be able to be able to be a collective and use energy , there &apos;s a little together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense , in the sense , that you can take a little bit crazy and also a vision .
and you really have to stay quite <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , new los angeles times , one day in the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , who played on a violin , just two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because from <unk> articles on it later a book , which was <unk> , with robert <unk> junior than steve <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , who was finished in the <unk> of schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived in the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i suggest all of you to read <unk> book , or to look at the movie , so she &apos;s not just the wonderful connectedness of understanding that between these two men , but how to make this link , it could be able to get this connection , and how to get the music .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , to walt disney hall hall .
he just had a demo of beethoven first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> sound about yo-yo &apos; and hillary clinton and hillary clinton , and it would be able to create the dodgers in the <unk> world , and that &apos;s all because of the <unk> passage , the first violin .
we got to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , in which said that nathaniel was interested in <unk> .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already treated with it , and he was treated with it , a trauma that has been done his whole life .
so as a result of it , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages . they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he died for days , in the streets of <unk> row , and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in fact , a <unk> was nathaniel , when we started with our first class , to walt disney hall hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he was talking about invisible <unk> and smoke and about how he wanted him in the sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his states , and i could destroy him to destroy his relationship with a violin , when i began to talk about a violin and <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence from beethoven <unk> .
and while i was playing , i found that in <unk> eyes , a complete change .
it was , as if he stood under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction , which was a catalyst .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding , in a stable curiosity , and you know .
and as a wonder he took his violin , and he started to play some clips of <unk> , and asked me to play it : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , started from bach on beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized it &apos;s not just a <unk> knowledge of music , but it was also a close personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and a understanding that i &apos;d just know about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by doing music , he was talking about music , was from this <unk> , <unk> man , who moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , in uganda .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to him , his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real <unk> .
and so he <unk> his <unk> conditions .
i understood that exactly the nature of art is .
this is the reason that we do music : so we do something that is deep in all of us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , to reality .
and the reality of that expression comes to us all , and moved , inspired and full of us .
what was nathaniel , so he brought him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and recognized him .
and i &apos;m always going to go back to nathaniel , whether in walt disney , <unk> hall or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i have become musicians .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen <unk> <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate thing .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it became the highest largest standards of sustainability .
so you might feel like to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the ceo called the company , and asked if i could tell you about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this incredible problem for our chefs is , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans that we &apos;ve got the forest of the forest .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , they collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s probably going to be or <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of you anyway , and they are inefficient , take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds <unk> are needed to get a pound .
not very sustainable .
not very good .
so here &apos;s finally a company that tried to make it right .
i wanted them .
the day before the event , i called the boss of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don &quot; well , i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , as far outside in the sea , they &apos;re not <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will be distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added up , &quot; we &apos;re essentially a world .
this <unk> of <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one ? what does you do ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and at that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what &apos;s the hell of hell ?
so i call the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to be a job .
well , i <unk> with a few people in the company , no one could give me a <unk> answer , until i ended up with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t don .
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in fact , two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
and i said , &quot; don &apos;t &quot; don , what is sustainable to feed chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i &apos;m actually <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after that entertainment .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you learn your fish , you learn the fish , you love the fish .
i first ate him in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came on the table with a bright , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
wait twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can do a fish so well , after he became <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least on the way that you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they have <unk> <unk> on what &apos;s essentially the wetlands .
they did that by taking the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and she <unk> water out of the land and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that work , not economically .
and it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds for this place .
and this was a spanish company called the country .
what did you do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally have the levers .
instead of <unk> the water , they used the canals to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a 11,000 hectare of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and the <unk> , and his company , the environmental destruction completely changed .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something .
they look at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you can see is <unk> channels and that density , lush march .
i was not a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to go . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and they fought us through the wetlands , and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up to my knees and <unk> <unk> .
here he takes a rare <unk> .
now he said the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of concentrate that reminds him to the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent the largest part of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
and i asked him how to be a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i know nothing about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and fall into more talk about rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had a <unk> .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it taste your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that this is a rich system that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one of a farm belongs to their animals ?
later , i went on this site , and i asked him , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems like , &quot; unlike any farm that i &apos;ve ever had , &quot; how do you do success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was if a director would have an <unk> .
and we bow around the corner , and we had the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of thousands of pinker , is literally the eye as far as the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you do your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to birds .
well , last year , last year on this room were 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest one , and one of the most important private <unk> in europe .
and i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> , not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he father his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker of the belly is the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that their animals don &apos;t drive and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you fly 240 miles on the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that , because they can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> , fly 240 miles to the farm and fly them from a year ?
do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , when i had a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that , because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i &apos;m almost never doing it .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant , they didn &apos;t have a <unk> at all .
she liked cute and in fact as if you take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> , and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last vehicle , before something in the body .
it has evolved in the course of evolution , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added up , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t get your fish , a farm , which is your success for success of their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have <unk> , he &apos;s massive , because the water that goes through this farm comes out of the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are rivers today , they tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , from <unk> .
and if it &apos;s been fighting by the system , and this leaves is clean , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that their animals don &apos;t drive , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , and not only for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and you should do it , because these love love , as romantic always , is also <unk> .
you could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , to actually taste well .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that that &apos;s the things that you know the future of good food is someone somewhere in and says , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> , but how will you feed the world ?
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not , because we &apos;ve been producing enough calories to feed the world anymore .
there &apos;s a billion people today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> , so it &apos;s not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because it &apos;s the logic of our <unk> over the last 50 years .
they &apos;re going to put the grain of herbivores , <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time has just said , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , &quot; it can be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the way of the american agriculture .
we should call you what it is , a process in <unk> , which is a process that allows fast to <unk> capital that allows that production .
this is not the process , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile land , not by pump , it &apos;s not by pump , but through fresh water , it &apos;s not by <unk> , but not through the forests of the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that provide every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it never has something really good for food .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that , that &apos;s two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses , who are not worlds for themselves , businesses , the creation of <unk> , businesses , who are growing up , rather than intense , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are those who are also experts in flavor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to see one thing today is that the sum of the data that we consume , bigger than the sum of your parts , and instead of thinking , i want you to think about how to use information , and we can see that patterns would be able to be visible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain death of death , say , accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in <unk> here , the people are the most likely , and they &apos;re over here .
we can go out a step further , and then the data is then new , and you can see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for anybody .
now , if we go ahead and go to age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we can see that accidents are even the cause to make people worry .
and who looks <unk> that &apos;s true in men .
so you can see that this is a look at information and data in this way , in this way , really remembered in a living <unk> .
and if we can do this for raw data , why does not be content for content ?
now , what we &apos;ve got here are the <unk> of every single &quot; sport <unk> &quot; that were ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually test it for my talk in your mind .
you can put them into a decade .
you can put into a particular year .
you can jump straight to a certain copy .
so if i look at here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an expert armstrong fan , so i click over here , and i click all over here in which these armstrong will be mentioned .
now , if i want to just get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the theme ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going back to a step and <unk> the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a idea of that , if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t want to look or not just <unk> .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit about what a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single <unk> , and they reduced them to a little summary .
so the summary contains a quick <unk> , and a symbol for the area of that .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the death .
but even in this particular view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense about the issues that are the popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue .
now , after i chosen &apos; government , i know that the <unk> , which is most of the time that most of the time is <unk> , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is an insight that &apos;s not a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just if you go back a step , and the whole thing .
you know , one of these summaries , i can go to the point of time <unk> , &quot; people in the year , &quot; and everybody together .
now , when i look at all these people , i know that the majority of these people are <unk> , some people come out of science , some of the things that come out of science . some , more than less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize .
you can see this , we &apos;re surfing on the net as if it &apos;s really a net , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what &apos;s going to be a little surprise .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can see websites that you can see , and we get this <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and just jump straight to a specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s important , because you &apos;re just looking at these kinds of websites in this way , and you can see the whole way of <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom in in a certain time in a certain time .
here &apos;s the one of the demo that i thought is the whole demo that i thought .
and i can sort of see everything i &apos;ve looked at today , again .
and if i look back to a step <unk> and look at everything , i can actually put my course back to my <unk> , maybe after my <unk> , and here i was looking for &quot; <unk> &apos; &quot; for bing , or here for live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side , and you call it back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and every time , it &apos;s bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a <unk> .
we talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation out , and the internet on the head , so that we &apos;re going to go from one to the other , we start to go from many things to many things , and you can see patterns that would be remained hidden .
if we can do this , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can know from that .
and if we experience knowledge , then we can even pull out <unk> .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus to school every day , every day .
and my nose would always put my nose in a book , a <unk> , which was my thinking about other worlds and in a <unk> way , my deep curiosity .
so , these curiosity also showed that i was not in school when i was not in school through the forests , through the forests of <unk> , and i went to the forests , frogs and snakes and snakes and <unk> , everything brought home and under the microscope .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limitations of the possible .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon , we flew the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our fascinating shows with his fascinating shows with his fascinating shows , and places and a world full of wonder that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
so that &apos;s probably very good at that <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s neither video games , this <unk> , with <unk> movies , had the whole images in the media media , i had to create the images in my head .
and we all had to all have that . when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> , and they looked at the canvas in our mind .
my reaction was to draw and paint from alien , alien worlds , robots and all this thing .
in <unk> , i was constantly caught up by the teacher , as i put up to the <unk> textbook .
creativity had to take some way out .
and this was something interesting about what i was fascinated by jacques <unk> was the idea of a completely unknown world on our earth .
certainly , i would never get an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic like all that , which i &apos;ve always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to the diver .
the only issue is that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let me just pause it .
i <unk> my father , until finally , a <unk> in buffalo , new york , had been made on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean is a real ocean , i only got two years later , when we moved to california .
since that , in the 40 years , they have been <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about three hours under water , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , as rich as rich life , as rich as we can actually imagine .
the idea of nature has no limitations , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
until today , i feel the deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the same intensity like ever .
when i was an adult , i was a profession , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to tell my internal , stories , with my need to create images .
as a kid , i drew comic books and so .
so movies were the way of the way , images and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i &apos;m doing is , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to <unk> my <unk> for the <unk> , and that &apos;s going to connect with the board .
so , in fact , my two loves .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- that we wrote on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what it came out was the first <unk> <unk> that ever had ever seen in a movie .
so the film has no money in which he was saying , it &apos;s just a cost of time , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was like <unk> from the magic that came out .
according to the arthur a.
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that has to be involved in <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , &quot; a lot further .
together with <unk> , we created the guy out of liquid metal . the success on the way that this effect would come out .
and it worked . again we &apos;ve created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money on the film .
from these two experiences , it was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend of <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
so the basic idea of this company was that the phase analog processes with visual printers , etc . to skip with digital <unk> .
and then we also did that , and they did a <unk> for us .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we found that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we actually had started the company , too slowly .
and i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which is written in <unk> of visual effects and <unk> effects in all new heights and <unk> effects in all new heights of <unk> , and the <unk> characters that were made by <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar got very beautiful . and people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t been able to be able to do that .
so i found this , and i took this other film over the big ship , which goes down .
i &apos;ve got this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; it was sold to a ship , and it became a kind of <unk> magnitude , a passionate film .
but in fact , i was going to have the real <unk> of the titanic .
so i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i believe them , but i said , &quot; we go to the train . we film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> .
that &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s going back back to the way that your imagination can make reality .
and then we actually created a reality for six months later a reality that i <unk> myself in a russian <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
that wasn &apos;t a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , it really got me out .
and it was enormous . we had to build cameras and light and all possible .
and i fell out , like this <unk> , a little bit like this .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go into this capsule , then you go into this dark , <unk> environment , where there is no hope to rescue if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was also obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the part of which has to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the <unk> .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , and for the science , when we saw them , it &apos;s still no words .
so that &apos;s really <unk> me , and i wanted more .
and so i met an unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as filmmaker as filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;ll <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started to go to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and we explored with <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , and to see the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
no one had launched the inside of the <unk> , and you haven &apos;t had a tool for that . so we developed the technology of technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting on , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and you see <unk> , which is pretty much like this <unk> here , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little <unk> of the ship .
i &apos;m actually <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like , as i was physically , in the <unk> of the titanic .
that was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner , i knew what &apos;s going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was going to run months about the movie .
and the set was an accurate copy of the ship of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize that you &apos;re using such <unk> <unk> , and so your mind in the vehicle in the vehicle , in this different form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> <unk> to explore something or other things that i can imagine as a <unk> .
after this expeditions , we started what we &apos;ve seen from the bottom , really value to learn , for example , this <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are like this incredibly amazing animals , but here on earth .
they live with help .
they don &apos;t exist in the process of the process of how we do that .
and so you see animals that are right to a 500 degrees fahrenheit that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , and that was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and to do with nasa , and they &apos;re sitting in the <unk> , and they &apos;re sitting in the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and then you go to russia , and then they take our <unk> , and they take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of the end , it went out that i took <unk> with us .
and i took them to the world , and i put them access to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to take samples and take instruments and so forth .
so we did it , but we actually did science , but actually , science is saying , <unk> .
so , the circle between my existence as a <unk> , at the time as a kid , and the use of the reality .
in the course of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure to think , you know , a director also has to be able to be able to have a leader like a <unk> or so .
but i don &apos;t mind mind a lot of leadership before i <unk> this expeditions .
because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what does i get ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of the cost . from glory .
all of the things i think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have <unk> the nails on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these movies , this pity , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it around the challenge , the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , which is there . you &apos;re doing it , and because of the strange link that comes out , if a little group of people can make a team .
because we &apos;ve been doing all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked around for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the lake .
and in this community , you can see that the most important thing you know is that you &apos;ve got a job for each other , because you &apos;ve got a task to explain any other .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole technology , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human <unk> , if you &apos;re working on lake , and you can never tell somebody .
there &apos;s a link , one of each other is respect .
so , when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i was trying to use the same leadership , which is that you serve his team , and they deserve his respect .
it was really changing the dynamic .
so , i stood back with a little team on the <unk> terrain , and we were called &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we have been in a time for a half a half years to a right family .
and it changed my way my way to make movies .
there were people who said we had this <unk> really well , and we &apos;re transported on the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the real process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close out of all that ?
what lessons is we learned ?
i think the curiosity is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the <unk> of your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , young filmmaker , who say , &quot; give me one advice as i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> you .
you get other other for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> , &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
but in art , and we need to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
no important effort , the innovation asked , was the no risk .
you have to be ready to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i want to give you to the way . fail is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
and that might be surprised by the foundation of the foundation , mainly around vaccines and seeds , around the things we invent and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more importantly than for anyone else on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing for many years , and we &apos;re not growing too much or too little , and the things will change their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty .
so , there will be a difference for you .
and also , it &apos;s very important for you .
the fact is that if you could only reduce the price of the price , it would be energy for far most effective .
well , the <unk> is the time .
in fact , it &apos;s based on <unk> .
the <unk> was the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and therefore we have refrigerators , <unk> , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s get the price of half -- we make a new barrier , and this barrier is on co2 .
co2 is the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences , effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the <unk> implication that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to the change and collapse all the systems .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and where the other implications are , there are some questions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these implications will be , but they will be extremely bad !
i asked the <unk> several times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
is not a half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero , the temperature will go further down .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a 3.5 feet high trucks , which has to go under a three feet of bridge , and you can actually put it down underneath .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we put a lot of <unk> every year , about 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that reduce it to zero .
it &apos;s just gone up .
there are only different economic changes at all , and we need to go from <unk> increase to reduction and to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a fake . you &apos;ve got this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to be to zero , and that will depend on the number of people , the average energy for any service , the average energy for any service .
so let &apos;s look at it every factor , and let &apos;s think about how we get that on zero .
probably one of these numbers must be very close to zero .
now this is a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
we first have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it <unk> on nine billion <unk> that are moving on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines that are <unk> and <unk> , we could be able to reduce it for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we &apos;re seeing a slope on 1.3 .
the second factor are the service that we use .
it &apos;s all about the food that we eat , clothes , television , heat .
so these are very good things and <unk> means to make these services almost every on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could be able to make <unk> and less benefit , but in average , this number will increase every year , and so much more than double , the number of services that per person will be made .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s a very basic way to read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so you go out and read your <unk> under the <unk> .
well , for efficiency , the e , the energy of the service , there is good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in <unk> , through other <unk> , through new ways , through new ways , there are a lot of service , and there are lots of service , which is a lot of service to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , as the creation of <unk> , 65 dollars : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; <unk> : <unk> , or the <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s a lot smaller than improvements .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might be able to get a factor of three or maybe a factor of sixth .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe 60 billion tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
it turns out if you can get that on zero .
if you burn charcoal : no .
if you burn gas , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity today are co2 , unless the renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
if i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
people have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
usually there is no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
typically , you &apos;re just going to go back , and some people come to .
but in this case , we have to give <unk> , and a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked me , how can i really get that ?
there &apos;s a natural <unk> , a demo , which is the idea of people here ?
and i remembered myself last year when i brought mosquitoes and somehow people .
and the idea was really tangible , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was one .
i decided that this would be my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you have told me that they don &apos;t bite . you don &apos;t think you &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or several of the things that have a unimaginable scale and unimaginable <unk> , and although there are lots of directions in which people look for people , i &apos;m really just five that can afford this big demands .
i have tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
maybe you might afford a <unk> contribution , and if you do better than i expect me , it would be great , but my message here is that we have to work on all these five work , and we can &apos;t give you , because all of you have significant problems .
so let &apos;s look at that first fossil fuels , burning by either coal or natural gas .
what you &apos;ve got to do there is maybe easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to be all the co2 that comes out of the <unk> , which is coming out of the <unk> , and then they &apos;re hoping that there is there .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> that can do that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get 100 percent , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult for the co2 in the co2 is a big challenge .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times bigger than any kind of garbage that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough thing .
next : <unk> .
that has three big problems . the cost , mostly in <unk> countries , the question of security , you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human interactions , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though it &apos;s not big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and where you should work on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve put in .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re often called .
and also , though , although it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- they have a couple of this .
one is the density that these technologies are dramatically creating dramatic times as the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , times more than a normal power power .
it &apos;s also <unk> these sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , and the wind is not always .
that &apos;s why you have to be , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have a way , the energy in times if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great <unk> here . there are challenges about transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t have the technology , you need to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from .
and there is <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made , looked at , looking at the cars , computers , mobile phone , mobile phone , <unk> , <unk> , and i found that all the batteries that we can produce , less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor 100 than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that happens when you &apos;re trying to do this <unk> sources about say about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest .
if you want to deal with 100 percent on it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where shall we go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we come to the goal ?
what we need is many companies that work on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
you will say , you &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many people who have already come there .
bill big has several companies , among other words , is a great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting ways , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold , and i fund a company , which may be surprising , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
so the development has stopped a few time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts came out .
the <unk> means that , instead of a part of the <unk> , which is one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had thought about a long time , but you could never simulate any point of whether it would work , but since there are modern supercomputer , you can see it and see that , yes !
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today as <unk> .
instead of break on it , they burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is going to use forever , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that there is a kind of plank , often as a <unk> wave reactor .
this is really the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that &apos;s 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
the u.s. <unk> for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re doing <unk> cheap and simple , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our statement look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve and then talk about the <unk> .
many talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be made in poor countries , and still something agriculture . hopefully it will be clean and cement down to clean .
so to reach this 80 percent , the developed developed countries , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other grade says , whether we &apos;re using the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
this is great important .
that &apos;s going to be a key issue .
if we go back from there , how should the look at 2020 ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to get reduction on the way . the less we &apos;re going to <unk> , the smaller will be the <unk> , and it &apos;s also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing , which is not entirely to the major <unk> , just right , or even something less important like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs we have to follow with <unk> , and we can measure that in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this issue .
al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david <unk> , &quot; <unk> energy <unk> . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this has been discussed wide , because we need to support for all sides .
there &apos;s some things that must come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very powerful wish is that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love this wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , i would take this wish .
this has the largest effect .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it will dig between long and more likely to make people terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all the lives of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
for what do i do ?
we need to use us for more research .
if countries meet in places like <unk> , they should not talk about co2 .
you should go to this <unk> , and they would be shocked by just <unk> <unk> for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , they &apos;re controlling , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade technology that creates something that makes a <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we &apos;ve got to make dialogue and <unk> and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us a sense of magnitude of this investment ?
bill gates : to make the simulation on a supercomputer , all of the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s important , it &apos;s only in the <unk> million .
so the hard step is building the first thing to find another billion , the <unk> and the place of actually building the first one .
once the first deal is , if it &apos;s going to be the first thing as i promised , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy that &apos;s so different as in <unk> , as we know them .
so to understand the right thing : that means deep into the ground , almost like a vertical plank nuclear <unk> , and then the process starts , and then the process starts up and does the process , etc .
<unk> : right . now you &apos;ve got to be new <unk> , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots and lots of controls that can go wrong , and this thing is where you open it and do things like that , and it &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can get it for 60 years -- think of it for 60 years -- think about a plank that you wake up without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burn 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which is a solution to the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens to the garbage : you can sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less garbage with this method -- you take it back to the next one , and they burn it up .
and we start by looking at the garbage , which has already exists in this <unk> or <unk> , that &apos;s our <unk> .
so that &apos;s a problem for these reactors , which was a problem , which is what we put in our own , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to increase in our own and that process .
but while you &apos;ve talked to various people in the world .
where is the greatest interest to do this ?
<unk> : now we don &apos;t have a place on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting <unk> for everything that is &quot; nuclear &quot; on the name . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people who were in russia , india , china -- i was talking about how this is the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
so this is a form of one thing that was made .
that &apos;s an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , so everybody &apos;s built a quick reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , the time and likelihood of doing something really really happen to life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
that &apos;s kind of the deadline that we &apos;ve got to start to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything &apos;s good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of that , the same thing , the same as their approaches to work for your pilots for their pilots to make it .
and it would be the best if you can do several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
you know , the great amount of breakthroughs is that the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s even more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> which seems something hard , but maybe that &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about this is a million times a million times a million times as much energy like one , say , a <unk> and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , the footprint and the cost , is the potential , the footprint and other things , almost in a own league .
if that doesn &apos;t happen , what ?
do we have to take <unk> , to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you go into this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and a heart attack is , what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or similar .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called the <unk> , which is using different techniques to <unk> warming warming , so we &apos;d get 20 or 30 years longer for us .
that &apos;s just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you should not be working on insurance , because it may be a lazy lazy , so you keep eating , because you know that one will save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in <unk> , whether you should have this discourse in if the things come faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sets of sentences to do it ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
say that there &apos;s negative implications that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there &apos;s very , very few things that you can see at all , where there &apos;s a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is similar to aids .
you make the errors right now , and you pay for a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of <unk> problems , to invest in something that you &apos;re starting to invest on later -- and that &apos;s what the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time you get the co2 , you also say the skeptics , you say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are suffering from malaria , which is a dumb waste of resources that we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- say , we should spend 10 billion a year than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
they should not suffer other things .
you get a lot of <unk> , and here you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that is not economic , and trying to fund that . for me , most of the waste .
it was , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the learning curve , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if you get <unk> , you can get a very high <unk> , you can only get the rich up .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times so much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why does the research isn &apos;t going to talk more ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to take the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it will be supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , he asked peter <unk> called a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> <unk> , the biggest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti , about a half feet tape , and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be up .
and even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s really hard to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i put it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students and architects and architects , even with <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task that allows deep sensations in nature , and i want to share some of them with them .
usually most people start to get yourself to the task .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about how it gets to look at it .
then , invest a little time in planning and organization , and they put spaghetti and put spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the world &apos;s <unk> .
and finally , soon before you don &apos;t have time , someone gets the marshmallow , and you put it down to the top , you go back to the top , and you go back to the top , and you go back to the top .
but then what happens , almost always , is that this is going to be &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> causes that the whole thing and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; as others , and under the worst are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there &apos;s a lot of teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and under the best , fresh new students .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
how peter did not just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is : how does this do ? why ? what about those ?
and peter said , &quot; none of the children spend time in the head of spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s what <unk> were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then you realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s going to do differently is that you &apos;re starting to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have the opportunity to repair <unk> prototypes .
<unk> , this kind of collaboration , is this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> .
and with every trial , the kids get immediately feedback and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , so much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average of the most is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , which is a little bit more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , happiness .
feet is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make robust structures .
ceos are something about average , but here &apos;s interesting .
you put a <unk> democracy on the team , they will be significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and see this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they run the process , you understand it .
and that team , and the work is going to look at the performance of the team , more important .
these are skills and <unk> and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the same thing , you get about six , the stable structures .
i was trying to do something exciting .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the <unk> right .
so i asked a <unk> dollar prize for the winner .
what do you believe about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this was happening here . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone had built a <unk> high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we moved this practice with the same students .
what do you believe that ?
well , you understand the benefit of the design .
so , from the same , bad team of one .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature , and success .
you might ask questions : why would somebody invest time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i help help help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does is , it helps to bring to hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or a common language , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this as simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in you can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples of all the world , like people optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> exercise .
it requires that we all have our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking of how our emotions and our doing , in the challenge that we &apos;re in .
and sometimes it &apos;s a little prototype of this experience of what it needs to take us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so , as we had a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everybody in this room must be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here .
and i ask me what you would choose because i asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they didn &apos;t want to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s looking for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of <unk> to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i must say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a explorers .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to do this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that had ever been on this planet , no matter how scale you &apos;re doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never time before this .
my <unk> died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents <unk> this number .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid that &apos;s born today in new new new zealand , as long as the richest man in the world about 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve got the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve <unk> them .
in the rich world there are disease , the millions of people have been threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are the successes of science .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to try and look things like it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in this world go to bed every day .
this number goes up , and it gets very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we have our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going to disappear , and if we don &apos;t go out of that chaos , we &apos;re going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that &apos;s going to feed billions without the country that they live , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t even destroyed .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is going to wake me at night -- one of the things that i think at night at night , we &apos;ve never had scientific progress yet as well as well .
and we had never been able to be able to make it <unk> , as we can do it today .
we &apos;re on the door to amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we &apos;ve got hundreds of , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time in which we &apos;re fighting progress in the way we have progress on this stuff .
people are going to believe in their belief , and it &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth will make you free .
and listen , everybody has a right to your opinion , even a right to the progress of progress .
but you know what ?
you don &apos;t have a right on your own facts . &apos; <unk> , you don &apos;t have .
and i needed a while to find this out .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve got an article on vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was surprised to get on resistance on resistance , which is the most effective procedure in healthcare in health care .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically changed food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people played nuts .
so i &apos;ve also written an article on this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules was a random kind of <unk> in the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went ahead .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to take rich , we go food , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and then i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these guys who didn &apos;t make me <unk> at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that brought me so much ...
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
we talk about it &apos;s ironic , with a little quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what reasons are that .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes they lost in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they &apos;re always right . be skeptical .
ask questions , ask you evidence , ask evidence .
you don &apos;t take anything .
but now it comes : if you get evidence , you have to suppose this evidence , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can say that in a epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which brought the <unk> with the war , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very frightening .
there were plenty of studies to see if that was true .
many studies should be done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in the united states , from england , from sweden , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no link , no link , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make a difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we can see what &apos;s going to make us real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> , which gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was a <unk> .
<unk> because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> for war is falling down .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i understand that .
because did anybody stand here ?
has one in the audience ever going to see somebody die ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but just 70,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death by measles , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can put it in and people like jenny , and people like jenny can go around , and messages from the fear and around the <unk> of platforms like oprah and larry king .
and you can do that , because it doesn &apos;t connect cause .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
it <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he just evolved with a couple of other people .
he can save the life of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty well , not ?
well , this is good , except that paul running around and over vaccines , and he says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop .
and that &apos;s actually saying that .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul was talking to a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell no poor <unk> .
he gets a calls at home , because people like to tell him how to go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them fort , turn the disease , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we &apos;ve got it in this country .
and that &apos;s worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
and i was writing a couple of weeks ago , and i think i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
nobody said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t get your child against <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s somebody else in lagos today in lagos , and flies to los angeles , right now he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours he goes and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t you do like it &apos;s not .
we love it in lying . we love this .
you &apos;ve all taken all of your vitamins today ?
<unk> , a little bit <unk> that helps you to start .
i know that they did that , because half of americans do that every day .
you take this stuff , and you take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
you can make your urine . they &apos;re almost never .
that &apos;s okay , they want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark .
i &apos;m a voice .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the car industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not do that . our health care system is .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us that can afford it .
so we &apos;re going to go away , and where do we go ?
we run into the arms of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really serious , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of <unk> here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it is .
and you know what ? if i say that , &quot; look at the people and say , &quot; what do you care ? don &apos;t people do what they want .
you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ?
because it &apos;s no matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or some <unk> , who wants to treat his patient .
if you &apos;re going to go on this way , where belief and magic evidence , they get to a place that they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people around , because he was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , which we know they can do the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that &apos;s worse than any other from this disease .
tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they &apos;ve always . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re right now is this kind of ridiculous battle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> food and <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it must stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , over metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every stick <unk> , every <unk> , has changed by people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we &apos;ve done it all .
we did it in the last hundred years .
and some of it has worked , and some of it is not .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it a little bit more , and of course , there &apos;s risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people to increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i must say i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re taking out of food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m always hearing is to hear : too much chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want enormous fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to catch seeds .
and you know what my answer to all that is ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we do that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s no country .
it &apos;s not a idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to do a real dead , and it keeps millions of people from flourish .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? has changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like <unk> .
it &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s it .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is : why do we do that ?
i mean , ask me , why do we do that ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , which is our light on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about to get people alive , and it &apos;s highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re doing so far , we &apos;re doing something guilty about what we do , i believe not guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we have to do that .
so , after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to go into this ridiculous time and in the future ? &quot;
on every case . i want to do that .
in the moment , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can ask this machine on all what we want .
we can <unk> them , where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;ll move them to where we want .
we have to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time , and we &apos;re going to go into the future , we will be happy to have that .
i know that we can do it , and as far as it comes to me is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , and it may be strange that a magician &apos;s interested in it , it &apos;s really interested , because you look at it as &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be a real real thing . &quot;
in other words , a measurable effect in some studies have shown a measurable effect , the <unk> , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to you , is a <unk> , or a kind of -- that &apos;s a measurable effect in the body that &apos;s called the <unk> .
a deception is going to be real , because somebody can be so .
so we can also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick , which is at least since the 1950s in every <unk> of children .
i have learned him from the <unk> <unk> magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so , see what happens .
the knife that you can investigate , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m going to keep the knife just in my mine .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of it , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time moving , as long as i <unk> here , nothing can go into my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopefully , if all you go , the knife will be <unk> by my naked physical detail .
it &apos;s actually so clear to his space that i can shake it , without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , not <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often get small kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look carefully , although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you are here in the room this trick .
he works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say , i say my wrist <unk> to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m doing my wrist <unk> is that the real secret of illusion is .
and in the moment , where i &apos;m doing my hand from you , so you can see them from the back , and you can see it from the back here , the fingers here , just from where he was in a position where he was so <unk> .
great trick ?
there is somebody sitting in the back , who had no childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> myself , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way that he can process information , one , two , three , but she sees as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not that . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s made there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by i &apos;m going to <unk> myself through this movement , and the fingers will go back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can make your friends and neighbors . thank you .
well , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
one year , or this , i read a study that was really really true .
i &apos;m not a doctor or scientists , and therefore that was an amazing thing .
and it turns out , if you offer a percentage of a white pill in the form of a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a certain measurable effect .
but if you make the shape where you &apos;re going to give you a greater , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue can change and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although none of these are any <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really really made me .
but it turns out that this is not all .
if you take a few , it &apos;s more effective than a <unk> .
a colored capsule , which is in the end yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
also , there &apos;s a role in a role .
a pill twice every day is not as well as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is .
... that &apos;s also a role .
and the form is a role .
and if you want to have the killer <unk> , you have to reach into a needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you make a patient .
that generates a very strong image in the head . that &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have a space .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as well as a capsule that works as well as the needle .
and none of it has some really <unk> property , and it &apos;s just our belief that makes us a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from this study that you have to reach up to a needle if it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is a <unk> <unk> long . she &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to start a little bit about it .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and through them , to put them down to the other side .
if you &apos;re <unk> , if you drop light down -- i put this a few friends night in the hotel room , and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and it was a woman almost .
so i propose if you get very quick , you look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it the same thing , you can also be able to see if you want .
so , it &apos;s like my meat begins at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m real sorry . do you do it ?
and so just a little bit of my skin , and on the other hand , again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had <unk> .
about that .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well .
i know what people think if you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> yourself to be the skin , just to have a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty well .
yeah , i know .
and people say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see it right . &quot;
people are going to come in .
let me show you from the near .
that &apos;s really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can do it .
i &apos;m sorry . if you get sick , look away , look away .
the people in the back or that , at some point , you &apos;ll see , you will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty striking , but if it was real , he would see it &apos;s a hole and there if it was really real , it would do it . &quot;
okay , let me take a little blood for you .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
now i would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this framework , and i think , in this scale , to make a real difference , i &apos;ll just get the needle just there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re happy to do . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people with the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness , &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in interest in happiness .
there &apos;s very much <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all these tide of work , there are several cognitive ones that are sort of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is actually going to act by these cognitive .
this is true for <unk> that are thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just a mess .
the first one is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word anymore , because we &apos;re doing it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could perceive it , but in the big and all , this is something that we need to leave up , and we &apos;re going to take the complicated perspective on what &apos;s well-being .
the second case is one of the experience of experience and memory : essentially , you can be between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the miserable fact that we can &apos;t think about the fact that we can &apos;t think about that well-being without the meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of somebody who had a <unk> after one of my lectures , who said a story , a story , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music .
and then he added up , really , really emotionally , it ruins the whole experience .
but it wasn &apos;t that .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
she didn &apos;t care because he was a memory of <unk> ; the memory was ruins , and the memory was all what he could keep on .
what &apos;s really about is that we could think about us and over other people in the sense of two species of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present , and the present to the present is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , which is the doctor <unk> -- you know if the doctor says , &quot; do it hurt if i &apos;m doing it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that that &apos;s the <unk> and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to make the doctor by saying , &quot; how did you feel in time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or so similar .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self , and the <unk> self , and that &apos;s part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and it really begins with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re doing about stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who have a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to detail . she &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to tell all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients here . these are your record .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s more suffering ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more suffering . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient &apos;s a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how do these patients thought that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient is a much worse <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because it &apos;s a very important part of the story , as it ends up .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and that was worse , where the pain was completely at the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a versus b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
you know , from the <unk> self , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually increase the <unk> of the patient , just to put the patient in there without to him .
that will lead the patient suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve got to do that the <unk> itself of the patient is a worse , and you &apos;ve got to do that the <unk> itself of the patient is a much better about the patient , because you &apos;ve given patient a better story about its experience .
what &apos;s a story of this story ?
and that &apos;s the stories that makes the memory , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
and that &apos;s a story <unk> , and it &apos;s different , major moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , <unk> the end .
well , the <unk> self lives its life .
it has moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve got this kind of thing -- you know , the psychological present is true than about three seconds , which means you know that there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month .
most of you will be completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and yet you get a sense of the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during this moments of the <unk> .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we &apos;re using in the world .
and as we use it to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that &apos;s going to keep the <unk> .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is about time .
from view , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly as well as the first week is , it &apos;s twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , it &apos;s hardly a half times better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time , the critical variable that is different from a <unk> self , and time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually those who hits decisions , because if you have a patient , you say two <unk> with two different surgeons , and decides what he should choose , which is that it &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose to choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which is a kind of <unk> itself through experiences that don &apos;t need the <unk> .
i &apos;ve got the impression that if we &apos;re doing vacation , which is very often the case , that means we &apos;re doing a vacation in the service of <unk> .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard , i think .
i mean , how much do we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the dominance of <unk> .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation that i had ever had , and i think relatively often in relation to other <unk> .
and i probably &apos;ve probably got from my memories on this <unk> journey , and i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had the peak of the &apos; war with 600 images , i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s a half hours .
there seems to be a jury .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you &apos;re doing more of you , there &apos;s a real question , why do we give memories so much weight in the weight of the weight that we &apos;re going to give in .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the <unk> , all of your images will be wiped out , and they get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you choose another vacation , there is a conflict between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of memories , you could get a answer , and if you could think of memories in the sense of memories .
why we choose the <unk> , which is a problem that makes us a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of the self leaves two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to one per self .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask questions : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for times is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of the luck of the <unk> itself over time .
if you ask happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy the person is to think about your life .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not different is going to be different to restore happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being that are the study of happiness for happiness .
the distinction between the fortune of the <unk> itself and the satisfaction of the <unk> itself is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked , what you think about your life and over their experiences , and there was other efforts in the direction .
so in the last years we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main lesson we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy to his life is , and it &apos;s really not much about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a impression of the relationship , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you would know something about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
you have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight to a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his <unk> itself .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness is going to be .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly saying to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky to maximize the two species of self , they &apos;re going to do very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;ve told here is that we really don &apos;t want to imagine happiness as a use of well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very short , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we &apos;re not going to look at the same things if we &apos;re thinking about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people have to be happier when they say , we say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can get some people at the end of california to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to see what happens with people who are moving to california in hope to be happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re thinking about it , you will remember how horrible the weather was in ohio , and they will feel that you &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of you how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we saw a couple of weeks ago , she told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome , which was a pretty interesting outcome .
is that something that you can do with you , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most exciting outcome that we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we were looking at how emotions vary with income .
and it turns out that under 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under its income by 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they will be more less happy , the poorer you will .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
what happens , it &apos;s obvious that money doesn &apos;t take a <unk> <unk> , but that lack of money , but that lack of money , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve , the more money is you .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to ask everything on your head , everything we believe , for example , on <unk> and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians , in general , that the country generally would take a <unk> like seriously , and they would do politics ?
<unk> : you know , i believe that there is recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will be slow down in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , she &apos;s going to happen in the u.k.
people are , you know , you should think of happiness when they think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss if you want to explore <unk> or whether you want to explore <unk> , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness , you can get very different depending on how they think , and whether you think about the <unk> self , or whether you think about the <unk> self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , it seems to me , or should least be the most exciting political debate for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to save it as easy to save the world in the reality , as it is in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince people to do more people , including all of you to spend more time with the play and <unk> games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you consider how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute on the future is that it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it &apos;s time at 21 billion hours a week .
this seems to be a little bit more <unk> , so i repeat it to be able to be able to do it : if we want problems like hunger , poverty , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to do games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this image describes quite exactly why i think games so critical for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings in play , so he was building a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the nuances in this image .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a fear , but also <unk> focus , very difficult to solve a real difficult issue .
if you play , you can see some nuances here , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the mouth is a sign of optimism .
this is a player , which is a called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . fine . so we have some players here .
a <unk> defeat is a result , which is so much positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked to be able to actually be able to be able to be able to do that . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is just a <unk> victory .
and this is what we &apos;ve got to see in millions of faces from the world in the world , if we take the barriers of the next century in attack , and the face of the next century , the face of the <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life , if we face hard problems .
i call it as a &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ?
that &apos;s me , as i &apos;m doing this , &quot; in life , i &apos;m doing bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my case , why we &apos;re doing better than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , even though that &apos;s heard .
we reach more . i mean , in the context of motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us can turn into our best version , any time , and immediately may be surprised to solve the problem , as long as needed to try to try and try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
and in reality , if we go on obstacles , we feel more different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings we never have if we play games , they don &apos;t have it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investigate as a student .
why is it impossible in play , to think , you couldn &apos;t get everything ?
how can we put these feelings out of play into reality ?
so i &apos;m looking at games like the world of warcraft , which gives me the ideal environment for exponential problem .
and i noticed some things that &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do in <unk> .
so , first , if you go in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are ready to make a <unk> mission , and it &apos;s immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so you can do this .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your skills , so they have to get hard . but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and <unk> . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are lots of employees .
where they &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to end its epic mission .
that &apos;s not so easy in the real life , that feel that in a <unk> amount of employees .
there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we &apos;re doing .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve been <unk> by &quot; level high , &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk : + one is talking , and a crazy idea , + 20 kooks idea .
i &apos;m going to get in real life in the real life .
so , the problem of <unk> like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at any point on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;d probably spend our entire time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> , <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nice .
but to see it in context , a hundred million years ago , our first <unk> started to go down .
so the first <unk> primate .
ok , so if we &apos;re talking about how much time we &apos;re currently talking about playing with play , it makes sense , when you think about the scale of human development , which is real .
but it turns out , because it turns out we &apos;re using this whole time to play this whole time , actually what we &apos;re going to be able to do as humans .
we &apos;re developing ourselves , very creature .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
so look at this interesting statistics that recently was published by a researcher at carnegie mellon , the average young man was published in a country with strong <unk> , spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first , for children in the united states , <unk> hours in the united states , <unk> hours of the <unk> , which you spend in school , from five to high school -- if you &apos;re never missing .
so we &apos;ve got a complete <unk> , on the young people as young people as learning what it means to be a good player , like anything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research , which is that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of a particular subject to the 21st of age , we &apos;re going to have to address it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people that are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are the player <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could find this out , we would have never been able to have any human potential .
so many people we have currently in the world who spend at least one hour a day .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people , the extraordinary good thing .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which is extraordinary good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed <unk> that save energy and work on <unk> , instead of doing that , instead of being able to do with the world , and particularly in india , china , china can play online .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a half billion players .
so i started to think about what it is , what it is , to follow these games .
here &apos;s the four things that i found . first , <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do immediately , to know something , and together with the belief that we have a more important hope for success .
and i always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders are social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of more interesting studies that show that we like people , after we played with them , even if you were playing .
the reason is that there is a lot of trust to play with somebody a game .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time with us to spend that the rules will be <unk> , that we have the same goal , and to stay on .
so it allows the <unk> to grow by ties , trust and each other .
as a result of this , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours play a week , like <unk> .
the reason is that if we play games , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard as if we relax , or nothing .
we know that as human beings work , if we do hard , major work .
and players are always ready to work hard when you get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it to become a part of awe <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> to go back to the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second <unk> of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
you &apos;ve seen more information about world of warcraft on the internet than over any other <unk> of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so that &apos;s four superpowers who lead to a single outcome , and players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to see the witnesses less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s a economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
so he says that really makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life .
you can make stronger social bonds as in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so he says it &apos;s currently completely clear that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i &apos;m just my voice , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , for 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
this amazing <unk> was <unk> .
and that was kind of the first of people have developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , games , in fact , <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> during a famine .
there was a great famine , there was such great famine , that the king of <unk> would decided to be a crazy idea .
people suffering . people fought .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy , and a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be very fascinating to the <unk> , because games are so fascinating , and we &apos;re doing with <unk> , <unk> productivity that they would forget there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to the <unk> , they survive so 18 years , these famine were eating these famine , by the next one .
so , i think , let &apos;s put games today .
we &apos;re going to play games to escape the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games in order to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not <unk> in the real life , and we get to what we need from play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king , the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they played a <unk> , and they were allowed to break into a <unk> adventure .
they <unk> <unk> , and they were looking for a new home , and they just went back to a new home , and they just went back to how many people were trying to survive , and they were looking at the rest of a area where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show you show that the <unk> , which is later , to make the <unk> rich , the same dna like the old <unk> .
so scientists had recently come to the notion that <unk> &apos; kooks is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> that took almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
maybe they actually saved their people through play , by being saved for 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> and so much over the other , that they learned the entire civilization .
so we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
that was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> , which was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years of warcraft .
i &apos;ll argue , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so they sent half of their civilization for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should be <unk> that half of us would spend one hour a day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask questions : &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; &quot; and this question i &apos;ve got my work in the institute for the future .
we &apos;ve got this protest in our office in palo alto , and we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best result , and then people &apos;re going to empower people to make this idea of reality .
we &apos;re going to imagine epic , and give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i designed to try to try to try to get people in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough <unk> , so it will be realistic for them , and you actually can actually live your real life without oil . so , if you go to the game , you can see how to live your real life , and you have to figure out how to make your real life .
we tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve covered them since over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an changing experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and say , &quot; we go from oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you go .
find out how they were going to survive , most of our players have been able to do this in the game .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next <unk> game , a bigger target than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve evolved the game &quot; <unk> &quot; on the future .
in the point , the computation is the computation of a <unk> that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to the player , we have a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientist , the <unk> , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , security , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 <unk> played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read , if you can see &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we take on the third of march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you end up the game , they get it from the world bank , &quot; social <unk> , &quot; by 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in the middle of africa and store them to learn social .
we have a comic comic book . we &apos;ve got &quot; level high &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you to invite all of you to share this game with young people around the world , especially in <unk> that benefit from their own social enterprise to save the world .
i get to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think is going next ?
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources in the real life , and that games can have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got this entire superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make close social nets , <unk> and the desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play a major games to survive on this planet to survive .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me such games and play .
when i <unk> in the next decade , i &apos;m sure for two things that we can create every future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s say the <unk> games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a few months ago , which is a couple of months ago on writing <unk> .
i &apos;m always writing my <unk> right right now , but i was done with the story of the text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never got in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled . &quot;
i read the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful .
i &apos;ve got this list of a friend loud , and i had to say , you know , it seemed as ridiculous , but i was just going to read &quot; my &quot; and i couldn &apos;t get to read it , and they had to end up with this <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought it must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i started looking at the elementary school , and it began to build my sense of self outside of my family , and to form my sense of self , and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
if i was going to take this point seriously , i was born in a world who would be able to perceive me as a person whose life can go positive , and today , i &apos;m going to have experienced opportunity and adventure that i experienced .
so i &apos;m going to get the <unk> of 2009 , and i would expect that i find a <unk> issue .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words of &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks , and the republican , really believed that there &apos;s a big force that has a big force , because that &apos;s what you can do loud .
so , what do we want to do is actually <unk> -- a disabled people or a powerful people ?
just to call people a kid as a child , it could be <unk> , and you know ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a man who opened up for me was my friend at the <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t get rid of it , and so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always was going to fly very colorful , and he was just created with kids like created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
and i had to be able to do a lot of a lot of such infinite times with this thick , <unk> -- in various colors -- that you know to build my <unk> , and i hated these down , i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even had a <unk> kid with dr. p. and so trying to stop this job , <unk> without success .
and one day , he observed me in one of my practice -- these practices were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;ll have a strong , powerful and young girls .
and if you make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect of the richest five year-old girls in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily <unk> .
and i ask me today , like this vision of me as strong and powerful young girls my sense of self , and i could imagine that as one of nature was strong , powerful and <unk> person .
that &apos;s just an example of many , as adults as adults can make the imagination of a child .
but how to prove this out of <unk> examples from the <unk> , we don &apos;t make our language to the language to imagine something that we all would want to allow us to find yourself as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes , which was caused in many cases through a technological change .
in the medical standpoint , you can tell , of course , that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> from titan and artificial <unk> for aging bodies that allow them to be able to use people to be able to use their own identity , and they &apos;re able to be able to create a different identity , and they &apos;re able to define yourself .
so maybe this technological change is clear because ever , that there was always another truth , which is that every person of society can make something very <unk> and very powerful , and the human ability can adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i &apos;m talking to <unk> , and i &apos;m going to feel very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think , i know why .
so this sentence from the relationship with <unk> lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on being a challenge , without that , to become a challenge , as though my life was so successful , because i could be able to avoid the way that my disability is .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re in the challenge , whether you &apos;re physically , emotionally , emotionally or even both .
and i claim that this is good .
<unk> is no obstacle that we need to do <unk> to come out with our lives better .
<unk> are just to our life .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s all the time i &apos;m doing .
and i want to have no effect of the impact , or the severe of the <unk> of a people .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just real real , and every person can go differently , but the question is not , whether we &apos;re going to be able to do with <unk> or not , but how we get it out .
so we &apos;re not just responsible that we love to keep the people that we love to keep <unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re also trying to get up well .
and we don &apos;t think our kids don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them feel that they can &apos;t adjust .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things : to be a medical fact , and you know , you know , the social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and <unk> disability , which i had to put away apart is that the world is constantly saying to describe me with these definitions .
in our wish , the people who are at the heart , and you &apos;re the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a forecast of life that they expect , we need to pay attention to that somebody &apos;s actually disabled .
maybe this is the current concept , which is just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we repair the repair for every single disability than the reason .
if we don &apos;t deal with people , and not all its forces and possibilities , we can do in addition to the natural battle that you might have to have another disease .
we <unk> a people who has a value for our society .
so we have to look over the <unk> , and we need to focus on all the area of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> .
we should not be able to see these <unk> times , or less , we should not try to avoid them , we should go down to the carpet , but it &apos;s about to recognize the opportunity .
so it might be more likely to ask me that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome <unk> , but that we &apos;re open for this , it &apos;s open to you to take a <unk> , and maybe even dancing it .
and maybe we can do it , <unk> as something natural , <unk> and useful , and feel that in their presence , it &apos;s not more like that .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . anniversary of charles darwin , and when he wrote 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in fact , in my eyes .
i would use it so : not the most powerful of his way , and also not the <unk> of his way , but the way that changes changes in the best .
conflict comes creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , from the battle of the human mind , is determined by conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we can only know what wood is we can be from , if we &apos;re really .
it may be the sense of <unk> , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can have a new meaning we can give out about severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> is a change for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted .
i think the largest damage that we &apos;ve done ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so honestly -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical . but not the normal thing , and would you really know that poor , gray person really want to learn if you really ?
i think , rather , not .
it would be great if we had this paradigm of normal against the other sense or the strength to be able to be able to be able to communicate a little dangerous , and you could put the forces of very many children , and they &apos;re willing to bring the forces of very many and valuable skills to society .
in fact , we &apos;ve found people from the members of our society always to be useful and make a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have older people , and people have older people , and people with severe physical injuries , and it may be , because the <unk> of these people in the society was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city that i grew up in the city in which i grew up in this &quot; red zone , &quot; in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there with a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , sir , you know ? i can &apos;t remember it . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may hardly remember me .
when i saw them for the first time , i took her mother . &quot;
oh , you know .
and , of course , it &apos;s made a click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man , which i knew just from narratives of my mother who knew about this day because i knew , of course , very typical , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor &apos;s physician was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my foot was born after you , and i just had a few toes on this , and a few toes in the other foot he was the <unk> , that strangers had to take the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents , you could never walk , and never would be like that if you could have a independent life , and then they could just lie me . &quot;
really , i found that he had been collected out of my own childhood , no matter whether i had won about a <unk> in the second class , whether i had my scholarship or one of my <unk> , and he used these clips to teach his students , and he used these clips to teach his students .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of human beings .
you can &apos;t stress enough to stress how critical this factor can be a human life .
and dr. <unk> told him , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if you don &apos;t always get something else , and even if you get a little support , if you get kids , you can get kids , and then children can get a lot . &quot;
look , dr. <unk> has changed it .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone do it , two different things are .
and i &apos;ve got my thinking about time in time , if you asked me at the age of 15 years , whether i had asked my prostheses from meat and bone <unk> , i would have no second <unk> .
i wanted to be normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is happening , because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , not despite that experiences .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve got so many people in the way i &apos;ve got so many people who have opened up to me , rather than people who were going to cut me , or i wanted to have an idea .
see , it &apos;s really just one people who shows you how to make your forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to activate its own , internal forces , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they get them to open up doors .
the real meaning of <unk> is &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to produce something that &apos;s in one , the potential <unk> .
again , what do we want potential to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , a case of case was done a case in the late &apos; 60s , and then they were transformed into <unk> .
you call that &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students will be <unk> .
and a student will be <unk> harder , they get better teachers .
and then you &apos;ve got over a <unk> period of time with a &quot; enough &quot; <unk> &quot; very good . it was told you , they were very smart , and after that three months she was written <unk> .
and of course , it turns out to hear the heart of the heart , it was said , they &apos;re only enough .
and it was the same time after three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had the school .
very critical at this trial , the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just got to say that are the <unk> and that are the students with the grade enough , and so they teach them something and they treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind that was broken broken , has no hope of hope . he finds no more <unk> of it , our natural , <unk> <unk> , and our <unk> ability to change .
but if we &apos;re doing it , but if we can do it to support the human mind , to always hope to find yourself , and other people around to find beautiful and <unk> , we put our forces really positive .
if you have a spirit of these qualities , we can make a new reality and new <unk> .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet named <unk> in the 14th century , and my friend jacques <unk> has told me , and the poem is , &quot; the god , who knows about four words , and the god , who knows only four words , but the god , who knows it . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right ?
suppose i said that in a few changes of your genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , and faster .
or want to be <unk> , more powerful , more force .
do you want attractive and confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have always been more creativity .
what would you enjoy most ?
what would you like to have to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about so many of the way there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very well .
how many would you choose a good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
some less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to say , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all a bug ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> issue here on the ted ted , but today , i want to give you the view of a doctor .
so , the great geneticists in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a paper , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not going to accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get rid of you , you take your personal <unk> , take your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you a look at kathryn <unk> &apos; book , which is why any sense of you will .
but if you accept biological evolution , think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other <unk> , or is it also ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve got a bush to put a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing <unk> of the tree of these branches have been successful : they &apos;ve survived it ; it has been fitness and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , is , of course , is what we &apos;re interested in most interested .
we bits of bits of common ancestors in modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years .
in this time , maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some are come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we would be quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but it &apos;s actually the largest part , the basic mechanisms is our cells quite equal .
is you clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacteria can produce to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat a <unk> .
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> from what &apos;s going on from the pancreas .
and when we talk about bacteria , you know that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads to the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times many .
i mean , think if antonio sent to your sense of self , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that they could only want to have no effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with <unk> <unk> of knowledge , forced forced to the outcome .
but otherwise , you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as you &apos;re important for your life .
and they help us to interpret it , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we a kind of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we going to become something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s go back to a step back at the time ago at 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about half a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living beings , maybe three to four billion years ago , maybe that &apos;s a lot ago than 800 billion years ago .
in this huge curious symphony symphony of the universe , it &apos;s just a moment on earth is just a little bit of <unk> ; the animal kingdom , like a single computer , and the human life , a little <unk> .
we were .
this is also the <unk> of this speech , so i hope that d ate you .
now , when i was a <unk> in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
and i fell in the power of evolution , and i asked , something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to go on both <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms began to change things .
sexual reproduction is coming into the image .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is going to <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of the death of the death of our bodies in evolution in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i &apos;ve got to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , death / death -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s got to be famous doubt .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , which in las vegas his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there is a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a very beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at it , and she says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
and i came up to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal of a goal , as a doctor , was the goal of evolution -- not necessarily <unk> .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to think healthy .
i wanted to restore health for a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the average of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;ve evolved as <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next level of the orbit to go back to the sea .
and i think we would all think of the mood , the <unk> all the way to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to immortality through my work .
i want to reach it by i &apos;m not going to die . &quot;
evolution is not necessarily the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> , and it could be able to survive the hot steam , if fish would be there , there would have a vacuum <unk> fish , but they &apos;ve managed to do a <unk> environment .
so , what does that mean when we look back at the back of what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space , the people in evolution , and most of all , as we go into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve done a kind of balance .
and the reasons for this would be that there were all of us through medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that would be otherwise , and from the population .
and second , we have a species , we have a species that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us , and we adapt to it , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we can go back and move , and we &apos;re doing so much that you can &apos;t say longer , that isolation is necessary for evolution , to <unk> .
a second possibility is that there will be a evolution of traditional way , of course , based on the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution is slow , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far , the isolation is , if we &apos;re a species , we &apos;re going to be , it will be <unk> and the changes of the environment that can produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just be simple , but led to us as a <unk> in the decisions that we do .
now how could this happen ?
how could we be able to do this ?
so let &apos;s look at the reality that people are doing today in some cultures in some cultures .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations , to cure disease and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic change to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or to eliminate the risk of the risk of risk or <unk> ?
would you not want to do it in your genes ?
if we <unk> , this kind of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it costs <unk> billion dollars .
in the next year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can do a sequence of three billion <unk> of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the room of a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long long , until the reality is that there will be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
before a week ago , the national academy of engineering , the national academy of engineering for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists that developed the natural process of evolution that encourage the natural process of evolution , to work faster , in a more efficient way -- which <unk> arnold evolution .
a couple of years ago , the <unk> of the scientist was given to the scientist of the scientist who was given a adult <unk> for his research in which he took a adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell greece , to go into a pluripotent stem cell .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that makes human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protection itself , but also to serve immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with vaccine that has been grown into the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a good thing that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
now imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and <unk> , or <unk> the fresh egg , could change their kids a better chance for a <unk> life -- eliminating the diabetes , the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want a healthier children ?
and then the <unk> technology , the same engine of science can allow the change to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the <unk> ?
why does not have the fast <unk> that will allow them to get faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
this will be <unk> .
and if we are in a place that we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the properties that we want to be , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that takes 100,000 years , and we can put it on a thousand years -- and maybe the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren or their grandchildren , or their grandchildren .
do we use these decisions to form a society , which is better that is more successful that is more effective ?
or will we choose selectively different properties that we want to do for some of us and not for others ?
will we make a society <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to face .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
in the good way in the evil , and before you might think , these decisions will be .
thank you .
i want you to imagine , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another one that helps to get up and go up and go up .
so , at berkeley <unk> , this robot is <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing else than something that makes them in the morning , and they put them extra strength , and it allows you to increase your pace , and it &apos;s going to help you to keep your balance .
that &apos;s actually the real <unk> of human and machine .
but not just that -- it &apos;s going to merge and connect to the universe and other devices there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking to the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the answer to carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- <unk> <unk> .
so we thought we would think that we would think of this challenge and create a <unk> that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : i can carry 200 pounds about <unk> terrain , many hours .
so , the flexible design allows it to be deep , to be deep , and highly <unk> motions .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go , and then my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re doing with this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our look at the wheelchair wheelchair , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who sit in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about a percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re talking about many young people with spinal cord , which in the <unk> of your life -- &apos; 20s , &apos; &apos; 30s -- the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , their numbers .
and so much of the only option -- if it goes to a <unk> , or to get other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been in the way for 500 years since his way i must say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the field of mobility .
so let me introduce you to you now , which will be carried by amanda <unk> , which was a <unk> of 19 years ago , which was the result that they couldn &apos;t run anymore for 19 years .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
its completely <unk> sensors on crutches , the signals on our <unk> , which is on your back .
here are also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as the <unk> that they &apos;re moving forward in this rather <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
it &apos;s not a doctor , and he &apos;s going to take a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he <unk> every single hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to learn me since , learning again , to turn back to <unk> and even drive the hands .
but nothing was invented to go back to me until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all <unk> , but for all .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m ceo of a non-profit organization called robin <unk> .
if i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty , i &apos;m <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteer <unk> .
now , in our city , in the volunteers of a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ve got to be very early on the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer , and i had a really good opportunity to get inside .
but it was still a race against the other volunteer to reach the <unk> and find out what our work would be .
when i found the <unk> , he just had a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which was certainly one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the <unk> , and she was in the <unk> and <unk> in front of a screen in <unk> , while your house was in flames .
the other volunteer that was just arrived in front of me -- let &apos;s call it <unk> luther -- got to go to the house and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who was now telling the rest of his life that he could tell people that he went into a <unk> house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was doing .
well , i was the next .
<unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you must go into the house .
you have to go up to the top , the fire , and you have to take some shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went to go down -- the stairs , the hallway , to the &quot; real &quot; &quot; the real &quot; <unk> , which was pretty much finished in the bedroom .
i know what you &apos;re thinking about , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i put my prey back to the bottom , where i met my <unk> , and i met my <unk> dog .
we put our value out to <unk> , where , not surprising , his much more attention than mine .
a couple of weeks later , a letter was a letter of the <unk> , where they &apos;re doing for the brave use of your house .
one of the most expensive kindness : somebody had a few shoes .
both in my profession , at the <unk> <unk> , as well as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witness of generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room , and you see people that can either get a <unk> success , or on your way there , i want to give the following memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for that to make a difference in the life of another , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give something , you &apos;ll give it .
use them in a <unk> , rooms in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will offer a chance to save the life of one person , but every day gives us a change .
so you put here ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going to go back from a community that knows the secret of humanity .
a place where women lead the <unk> with sex with sex &apos; hello , and the game determines the day -- which is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your blood disorder .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos are together with chimps , our next living relatives .
that means we have a shared ancestors , a evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
during chimpanzees , fear <unk> guys will be led by <unk> female .
and they really have this thing , because that leads to a very <unk> society , in the lethal violence , it hasn &apos;t been observed .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known as primates .
they live in the depths of the <unk> , and they &apos;re very hard accessible .
the congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the place of a violent argument that has been <unk> for decades and almost so many life .
it &apos;s not surprised that these destruction are the survival of the bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> lead that you could not even put a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence , and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh , that the trees are <unk> .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; <unk> , because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that , that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the life of bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s a part of the mission of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
playing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of relationships , diversity of connections .
and if you see bonobos , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> , which is <unk> us .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique footage straight from the wild .
first , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
that could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she takes him at the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more , not true .
yeah !
so <unk> are spread , both with bonobos than people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because it turns out to be a new elements where you get new elements to play -- as it makes a piece of fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of forms that are a little <unk> , which are some more <unk> , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the wonder .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays your water .
i think exactly how they &apos;re going to play , and we &apos;re <unk> limitations of our inner and external worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact , and the unexpected brain that we form is the real range of creativity .
this is just a little bit of <unk> on the insight , the bonobos in our past and present .
but it &apos;s also a secret for our future , a future that we need to adapt to rising challenges , through greater creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to be successful in a <unk> world , we need to play play .
but will we make the best part of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people alike , it &apos;s not the life of teeth and claws alone .
just if it seems to be hardly appropriate , it might seem to be play .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s give you this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re talking about creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in the middle of 1979 , in the same same day , in the same same day , in the same same time , every baby &apos;s a baby -- okay .
so two couples , every baby <unk> .
now i don &apos;t want you to take a lot of time to imagine the <unk> , because if you imagine all the time , you will not listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , that in a case , a y <unk> is wearing a y , which hits the x chromosome .
and in the other case , this is a x <unk> , which is the x chromosome in the <unk> .
both are <unk> , both light .
we come back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two minds .
under a hat , i &apos;m working with the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m studied <unk> , and in this case , i study people with anatomy -- which is human body , animal body -- how they thought about <unk> <unk> , with <unk> .
the other hat that i was wearing in my work is the activist , as <unk> -- or , as i say sometimes , as medications -- from people who are patients who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i &apos;ve worked with people who are twins twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller as usual .
and very often i worked with <unk> people , whose gender is <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes into many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples for the kinds of <unk> , which is not the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> leaves the <unk> , which we &apos;ve all got to have a <unk> stage .
and that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to be testosterone in the <unk> stage .
but because that individual the receptors are missing to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction on it .
as a consequence of the body , the body is the typical female process .
if the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
but it doesn &apos;t matter until they reach puberty and they grow their breasts and develop them , but they &apos;re not going to get your period until somebody comes out there &apos;s something different .
and they &apos;re doing a few tests and find out that they instead of <unk> and adults , in reality , and they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that this person could be really male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something that you call <unk> .
you &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , like i -- i believe a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women as i &apos;m talking about .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the implication is that somebody like i actually have a brain that was exposed to more <unk> , as a woman who was born with testicles , and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , can be distributed over the whole range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , when boy was born , he had a friend , he was living with his friend , had sex with his friend , and he had just found that he was <unk> and one uterus .
he had a extreme form of a <unk> form .
it &apos;s got <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , it was so much active that they &apos;re essentially made a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> was <unk> , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody knew something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he <unk> the doctors found that he was in the internal female .
okay , just a quick example of a form of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , creating something that &apos;s called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason that children with this kind of body -- is it <unk> or <unk> twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often , they &apos;re often adapted to the norm , is not because this is for your physical health .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
the reason that many different kinds of surgical surgeries will be done , is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain distance is <unk> with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman means to have a female identity , which is to be a black person , is supposed to be a black anatomy in terms of your own story .
so we have this awful <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , which is actually something very different , confused us in terms of this <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , if children are born , the two people in a body .
where i had experienced most of the excitement in the last time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender was asked in berlin .
a lot of journalists call me the question , &quot; which is what you &apos;re going to do that tells us whether <unk> <unk> female female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that it doesn &apos;t have this test .
we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to say that nature doesn &apos;t have to say that nature has no line between male and female and <unk> and female and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , we are that the line of that , of course .
so we have a situation that we have a situation where we &apos;re going to turn our science , we have to say that these categories that we thought we had thought that very simple <unk> , to create permanent <unk> categories , which is a lot of <unk> .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true about race , which turns out as much more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
in our world , we go into all kinds of <unk> areas .
so we go into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re just different about a few <unk> ?
while we continue to go forward our science , we get increasingly in a zone of the <unk> , where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see that in all kinds of areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see is to see the <unk> in our culture today , in today today , the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we &apos;ve got hard conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body to people , so he will have a different right than changing life .
we &apos;ve got very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when somebody &apos;s dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight with the question of when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve just kept a spring under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them .
if they &apos;re not moved , you &apos;ve buried them .
but today we &apos;re in a situation today where we take people <unk> organs and put them to other people .
and as a result , we <unk> us in the battle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have so simple categories like that .
now you could think that the whole road won &apos;t be happy to make me happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i must admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , makes me stand up .
and it makes me to be able to think about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i first have to say that i &apos;m a big fan of fathers .
i know that they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in which what they did that i &apos;m doing that i &apos;m going to look at the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going to happen with the <unk> .
the fathers were in my view of view the original <unk> , and that &apos;s why .
what she was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they replace it by another , which is radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you remember all , our fathers , the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy on the reason is a very simple concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power to have these political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather for the father , and so on .
fathers took this idea , and they replace them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people have been created .
they <unk> the field , and they decided that <unk> , the common care of common , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did that part because it was part of a <unk> system , in which two things are in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up .
if you look at the story of china , clearly that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations <unk> way , and meadows things like a supernatural concept of power , back to where the transmission of a very <unk> process of <unk> is based on a very <unk> process .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they talk about nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of them , they did a concept that was a concept of <unk> .
and so they have a really wonderful way to make the future movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years afterwards ?
for example , women , which is the <unk> <unk> , the concept of fathers , which says there &apos;s more important important than the current difference , and they said , &quot; we should have a uterus and <unk> , &quot; that we should not have the way that we should have the right , etc . &quot;
and women <unk> that successful .
next to the next , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> , &quot; am i not woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of <unk> , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin skin color , which are <unk> in places that are <unk> , again , to succeed .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the similarities , we have to start to ask the question of why we sustain certain <unk> .
well , mind , i want to be able to get specific <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you the same thing , for example , not the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to get your informed consent to sex or to marry .
so there &apos;s some risks that are <unk> for me to make sense , and we think , i think .
but the challenge is to try to try to figure out what it is , and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that are <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , in the same same day .
imagine that one of you , maria , three months <unk> was born , so she was born on june june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other side , will be born , he &apos;s born at a march 1980 .
just because of the fact , maria &apos;s three months <unk> was born , you get all kinds of <unk> three months ago -- the right <unk> sex , to choose the right to drink it .
<unk> has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of his birth .
we &apos;re going to find other <unk> about what your rights are .
<unk> , because you think that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the <unk> -- because you think that he &apos;s male , he can now have a worry , what maria doesn &apos;t worry about .
maria there can &apos;t be able to perceive the same right in all states , which has <unk> in every states , and it &apos;s right .
<unk> can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are important and questionable questionable .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science , we &apos;re going to do this progress in the context of the anatomy , that we have to get a point where we have to say that democracy could be on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to leave science , but at the same time , it feels more than whether the science makes the science .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture seems to take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we have to pull somewhere else , so we &apos;ll pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people <unk> in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas , texas , at a point decided that , to marry a man , that you have no y chromosome , and a woman means you have a y .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his , &quot; i have a dream speech . &quot;
he says we should not say people to &quot; your skin skin , but after the characteristic of your character , &quot; judge , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you tell people about your <unk> ?
and i want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should have right to make rights in terms of human beings , because i have to say that i know a series of golden <unk> , which is probably likely to make social benefits .
i want to be <unk> , i probably probably know some bright <unk> , which are <unk> , more intelligent and more efficient decisions about their sexual relationships than some <unk> that i know .
so how do we get the question to the properties of the character ?
it turns out as hard .
and part of me wonder , what if the content would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- using an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is in the way that the united states is in it to make thoughts about democracy .
in our lifetime , we &apos;ve got our things really well , and i think we would make our things in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like the case in iran , is where a man who feels in sexually to other men who &apos;s drawn to the death with the death , it &apos;s been willing to be a <unk> in which he could be alive .
the states of this kind of exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon with which i was talking about a couple of years ago , which had a couple of <unk> twins , to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was doing it with him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high operations operations -- his answer was that in his country , these children would be treated very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
and i said to him , &quot; well , they moved political , rather than a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible ways to allow people to be the ones that they are , without the state of the state .
that &apos;s why i think , we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked very much about fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of how democracy could look like , or could have looked like the mothers more involved .
and i want to say something that &apos;s radical , and that &apos;s what i think there could be different kinds of insight that could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use different kinds of anatomy , <unk> by different kinds of anatomy .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research for research .
and one of the things i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , in average -- not any , but not any , but in average , complex social relationships and the care of people who are in the group of vulnerable .
and therefore , if we think about this , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i did a graduate school , i asked my interest on feminism , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so it &apos;s a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> stereotypes about gender , therefore is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
that &apos;s going to be hot , there could be something , in average , which is what female brains are different from male social relationships , and <unk> <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the fathers were extremely clear to find out how individuals could be protected by the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re not just how to protect , but how to make for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we had to go to the future if we have to go democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies to think about that identity and more about relationships .
so , if we &apos;re trying to try to make a <unk> link , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it to find a different <unk> , crazy outfit , to carry , and to photograph in the last time , and to be blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the influence of my <unk> to the environment , and also that on my wallet .
i meet all kinds of amazing people ; my dollars serve for a good point , i see pretty unique ; i see it &apos;s pretty unique ; and it &apos;s doing it to my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
will it have my size ?
i &apos;m going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all answers , i feel like i won .
i get back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve got this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does somebody do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought here .
i brought seven couple of children , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve got <unk> that i could wear anything else , which i might have to find , if i came back to palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard about me as the woman who walk here at ted in her underwear -- i mean , i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i want to show you my <unk> for this week .
sounds that good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to leave you some of the lessons that i think you don &apos;t have to believe , or not , you know , i &apos;ve learned to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call it the open tiger .
you don &apos;t have to take much money to look great .
you can always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole kind of outfit , including the coat , has been 55 to 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this entire week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad to be bad .
if you &apos;re happy , you put other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation will be completely <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life , trying to try to be myself , and at the same time .
be just who they are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they will not only understand it .
wednesday : hug your own child .
and sometimes i say people , i saw people , as if i can play &apos; love &apos; games or that i remember it .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think , you look at something good , it &apos;s almost secure .
and if you think they don &apos;t look good , they probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe that they &apos;re a wonderful person , there is a wonderful person , there is nothing you can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anybody here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> .
and finally , saturday : you know , a unique thing to develop personal style is a great way to tell the world , without having a word .
and it was always coming over and over again , if in this week , people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate it all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let .
i don &apos;t have to be emotionally <unk> , because right around the corner , it &apos;s always going to be a different crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just wait to me when i have a little love in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
think about this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this image -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this image in italy , but the reason i &apos;m going to show you is that this is a very interesting one in the past decades .
some time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula one race , then they took her budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something that has a car in real time , some thousand sensors , the information from the car , and then we can use it to use this car to make things in real time .
this would be , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is interesting is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities have been , in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to go to computers .
and as a computer in the free , they start to react to other ways , and it &apos;s seen and driven .
if we <unk> cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , you put all this vision and power in objects of daily life .
this is from a exhibition called paola antonelli at moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; that . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom gets out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is changing the interaction that we &apos;ve got people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as opposed to the moses , it means that he took the hammer , and he took him on his hammer , and he threw him on moses -- you can actually see a little place <unk> , and why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i want to imagine is in fact one of the first of our labs .
it was a half four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done there was actually a new way of using a new kind of network that was used around the world -- that &apos;s been used to be used in the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and anonymous and <unk> information from this network that will be collected up from the lawyers .
the summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
it was in italy as italy .
some of you will remember it was played in italy as italy , and then the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , in italy .
now you look at what happened in this day , just in looking at the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
in the morning , the game .
you see the timeline .
earlier afternoon , people here and there is the calls and move .
the game begins -- silence .
france does a gateway . italy does a gateway .
<unk> , people do a short call , go on bathroom .
second <unk> . the end of normal <unk> .
first extension , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big key .
the next day , all the way to go into the center to make the <unk> and the prime minister .
and then all down .
you can see the image of the place of <unk> <unk> , where , since the roman time , the people who go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the implication of the day .
well , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way , in a way , in a way we couldn &apos;t .
again , another example of mind is , this is not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
well today we know all about where our stuff come .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , as they came together .
but we just know about where things go .
so we &apos;ve actually designed some little marker in this project to move out of the garbage while he goes through the system .
so we &apos;ve started with some volunteers that helped us , something more than a year ago , in seattle , helped the things that you can see -- different kinds of things like you can see -- things that they would go out .
and then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage and start to track it .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can make the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup that we throw away , not just disappear , they &apos;re still anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;ll always throw away every day .
and if we &apos;re going to show that , then we can drive a behavior behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could give you a lot more about that , and the many other wonderful things you can do with can do with you , but i want to talk to the second part , which is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something we &apos;ve done a few years ago in <unk> spain .
and it started with a question of <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a nice tradition to use public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
and one of the ideas that have been <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , you know , imagine this tubes , and valves , <unk> , work and close .
they &apos;re going to do something like a <unk> <unk> of water .
if these <unk> fall down , you can write patterns , images , images , text .
and you can go to it , and it &apos;s going to open up to make them <unk> , as you can see on this image .
well , we introduced the mayor <unk> .
it &apos;s very like him .
and we got to design the mission to design the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you go to it , it will open up and go in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and when it &apos;s windy if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even get the roof down .
or you could close the building and get all architecture , like this case , you know , that days , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you get the building . &quot;
no , you don &apos;t have the building destroyed , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost away .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who happens to what happens inside .
and here they look at me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not wet .
now , i should tell you what one night was happening at night than all sensors stopped .
but in fact , it was more more fun in this night .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that opens up to take them , but a building , which is still silence and holes in the water , you had to jump off without wet .
and that was , very exciting for us , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , think about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the nice thing to create things that will be used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections of it .
and this is what makes us think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine this <unk> could really start to fly .
imagine , you could have little helicopter that flies through the air , and every one of them with a little <unk> with a little bit of <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like that you &apos;ve seen before that is moving with others , completely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display , like this -- a <unk> formation .
or <unk> in three dimensions , which is what changes the light is not the position of <unk> .
you can play with different species .
imagine the screen in front of the screen just could appear in different <unk> or sizes , different <unk> .
but then it could just be a 3d cloud from <unk> , and they can go through and move through them , which you can see from many , many directions .
here you can see a real <unk> , which is <unk> to form a <unk> <unk> .
if you turn the light on it , it looks like this , so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people will be used .
it could have a single <unk> one that comes from people , from the motions of people or so forth .
i want to show you a little bit .
we &apos;ve worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we took his motions in 3d , to use it as a pulse for the <unk> .
you can see <unk> <unk> .
on the left side , you can see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s at the same time a <unk> and a <unk> .
so they can make the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all <unk> , you can play with it , and with color motion and <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible pulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympic games in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going back to the people to do something and change the environment -- almost something like we call it to be a <unk> , but in a cloud with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for a <unk> .
and i think the remarkable thing about what happened last years , the last decades , is that we changed from a physical world .
that &apos;s all digitized , knowledge , and makes it accessible through the internet .
today , we can get up for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- we can change from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the world .
that can be , in our case , we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can take us to ask us the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world .
so the idea is that we actually actually engage the people in which they &apos;re doing things together .
the cloud is a cloud of <unk> , in the same way , in the same way , is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical device in london , but with <unk> .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and technology , and it &apos;s as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go on , like london new <unk> .
you can go .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who want to go to the tip .
thank you .
as artists is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people aren &apos;t separated by nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
i don &apos;t <unk> awe .
my heart comes out , i was <unk> , while i was trying to believe what was faced .
the <unk> around me around me , almost 60 feet from the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake .
i &apos;ll be born as calf as calf of a glacier or by <unk> out of <unk> .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their surroundings and their experience .
some of them are <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do in a <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you can easily be isolated , separated and alone , as we can see people often .
but the truth is far from it .
while a iceberg melt , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg , it turns out it &apos;s free drinking drinking drinking water , which does lots of forms of forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my footage of this <unk> , as i would make portraits of my ancestors in consciousness , in consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments , and never get back again .
it &apos;s not death , if you melt it ; it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> of your <unk> along the life cycle .
a part of the ice in which i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so the last images i want to show you to show you is a iceberg that i put in <unk> into greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually watching a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the form of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , he begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
that &apos;s the average size of a <unk> .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , it shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by doing some amazing projects .
but at the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of that .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes again .
i stood up with him .
i &apos;ve got a company that makes design and animations , graffiti is necessarily a complex part of what we admire in the world &apos;s art .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what will you do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk back to tony .
i just want to go back to him , and i asked him , &quot; well , time , it &apos;s not -- i saw stephen hawking , can not talk all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about higher <unk> , and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
does somebody saw the film and <unk> ?
so they communicate -- so they &apos;re running along .
i <unk> , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came with the need with the need , just a check , and instead i asked a check out of that i was not going to know how to <unk> it .
and i put myself in place and ask his brother and his father -- to say , &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony will speak , we &apos;ll get him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to do it again .
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who does all this is not communicate it .
so i was talking a few months later in a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and you have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface , and then to draw up with a <unk> , which is just the negative area .
so they pull around and make <unk> like this .
you say that all things that are shown up there , a life life .
it begins with the <unk> , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , after the end , the <unk> , and finally , people actually do art .
but there was always a life life in his presentations .
so i went home and ate my wife with my wife , and she told her by all , and we thought , &quot; well , second times , if there is this technology that can use your eyes to control things , and then we should find a way that he can use his eyes . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have some things .
one , we &apos;ve got the doors to the doors , and they actually get a device for <unk> a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really funny -- i call it <unk> , because you &apos;re talking to him , or get a email , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from the entire world -- literally from all corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children , and i moved into the garage , and those hacker and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we &apos;re beautiful stupid to do that , and that we were <unk> and all images on the walls would be <unk> .
but for two weeks we &apos;ve programmed , we went to <unk> in venice , my children , and we &apos;ve created this dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something <unk> , and a few things from the hardware and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , you &apos;ve got <unk> , they put them on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s free accessible -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code for free , the software can be able to download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free from limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
no hospital .
now , every <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so in the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this image , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all this <unk> of the great revelation .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony &apos;s first time after seven years .
and that &apos;s an amazing picture , because this is his life life system , and he sees his life system .
we can see his bed , so he can see it out .
we put a space on a wall against a wall of the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what was a feeling that was in the parking lot .
so we had to be able to <unk> in the parking parking lot into the parking lot , so we felt a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he would send us an email with the question , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve got something .
i feel the feeling , i was going to put out under the water , and finally , someone gets up to the bottom and my head , i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s something like our <unk> .
that keeps us in the shelf , and we &apos;re always developing us .
and we have to improve a lot about this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s the same one .
and somebody who has such a <unk> potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re doing this to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since this time we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves .
it &apos;s all of our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , has been honored for us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010 , which was really neat .
so the <unk> of this is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that it &apos;s the entire circle -- that this april , in the middle of los angeles , a exhibition is going to be a exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> &quot; kind of <unk> .
and there may be pretty much the hardest part of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty useful .
so , in fact , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then we can do it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , that stage , this <unk> , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never been able to do something with <unk> , but i just sat up with amazing people , so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should everybody ask each of you and each day that you &apos;ve got to do something that has to be done , it must be done . if you don &apos;t know when ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably most american mostly <unk> .
and i tell people that i don &apos;t want a scientist as a scientist .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but nobody &apos;s elected farmers .
today , i want to tell you from circles .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go to the block and take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of which i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one week that every week in the <unk> green and blue was beaten my life .
she saved my life by making me the toilet in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what they did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it a work of work on <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i received a call from this teacher &apos; call , <unk> , who said , &quot; i must see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults .
can you come back to ohio , and please come together with the man , which i know you have found it .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to go back . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for you , we brought them down , and we had them around them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who was teaching me to learn as adults , i met myself , turned out into a box , and she was placed in my hands .
what happens was that the circle was closed , it was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i &apos;ve talked about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs all the rest of life .
he takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that that &apos;s been mentioned today .
he needs the same thing -- it would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while it &apos;s on 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a engine called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one that could talk to the <unk> .
so , i saw them in the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we probably put some birds . &quot;
the pilot had been <unk> , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened .
the pilot set the machine to the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns out the engines .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the <unk> .
i was able to see it in your eyes , because i was hearing life .
i want to tell you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to make a hand , and it wasn &apos;t doing all the fences that i wanted to do and never did .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying a saying , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is far , and the person is there , then i open it .
i don &apos;t want to change more .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we put the george washington bridge , so pretty much <unk> -- because i thought , man , there is one thing that i &apos;m really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my errors , i &apos;m going to be able to be able to get better in everything i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego space .
and i &apos;m looking at the time that i &apos;m going to produce for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i was thinking about this , i decided that negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have to have right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the inside o &apos;clock in the internal o &apos;clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ...
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts , as you know it from a monument .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , is not scary .
it &apos;s almost like we were going to prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness <unk> really is in a thought , which is that i &apos;m just a happy wish .
i only wish i could see my children .
about a month after a month after , i went to a display of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> .
... yet .
and i <unk> , i know how a little kid .
and in the world , all of a sense for me .
and i realized that by the time , when i connected the dots together , it &apos;s just a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my single goal in life to be a good father .
and i was going to be the wonder in this day .
i received another gift , which is to see in the future , and back back to life .
my call to all that flies today is : imagine that the same thing happens on your flight -- please -- but imagine , imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you do to do that , because you think they would be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy ?
and more than anything else , they are the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb .
the most important one there for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here are <unk> .
now , if you can do this , the systems of <unk> , which control <unk> and valves , then we can actually make a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , an effective <unk> on a laptop , which is used by a <unk> , to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are going to walk into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> in the wake up there -- mission .
that &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started doing our research , six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the point and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most important part , the <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed a little bit <unk> , with these gray boxes , that <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our surroundings with <unk> infected , and we studied this building .
and then something odd happened .
so , <unk> <unk> , like a <unk> , which didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> , but couldn &apos;t eat it .
that was no point in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a <unk> attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the gray box , when a particular configuration was discovered , even when the particular program that &apos;s trying to do it on this goal .
and if you don &apos;t , it &apos;s nothing .
so that &apos;s really my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , say , for example , a <unk> american power , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should get better about what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> we found the <unk> code , and found that he &apos;s <unk> in two digital <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger .
and we also noticed that they were very powerful , from people who had obviously all <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that had to attack .
you probably knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we talk about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking at first was <unk> <unk> , because we know what it makes .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring these with the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these targets that we could prove or disprove .
so to make this theories , we call us in memory , that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to act a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be reported in iran because there were most infection .
well , in this area , there is not several thousand goals .
in fact , it goes out to the <unk> power of power , and on the <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; take a list of all experts for <unk> and power power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and then you know , you know , to compare your expertise to what we &apos;ve found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
and the arrow is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this <unk> , then you &apos;re in fact , in fact , in fact , to crack it , and finally , the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack actually was , it was very slow and more useful -- obviously , in trying to be able to do <unk> , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get fast behind it .
the great digital <unk> -- we &apos;ve got a glimpse of that by taking us very carefully and <unk> .
so , for example , the number <unk> is very much <unk> is very much from this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started to <unk> scientific literature about how this <unk> was built in <unk> , and found out that they &apos;re <unk> in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it became better .
these <unk> in iran are covered in 15 so-called layers .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , it was really good together .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied here .
well , you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
and many times we were going to go into a <unk> , and they had to be new .
anyway , what we found is that both digital things we found in reality and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and <unk> the memories and slow them and slow them up with six <unk> in interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in the big , we &apos;re very confident we &apos;ve actually determined , which is the goal .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about that other goals could be met by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- it &apos;s really <unk> me .
the bottom is the gray box , and on top , you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing does is that it &apos;s going to do that it &apos;s the <unk> values of sensors -- so for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> code , which is still in the attack with the wrong stuff .
and in fact , this wrong stuff is made by <unk> data .
so it &apos;s just like that in <unk> , where during the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just that <unk> <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t react fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the big <unk> will be fast , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and when the risk are in risk , they can really happen .
it can explode up .
and not the <unk> , again , it will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s still worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing specifically to do with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work just as well -- in a power station , or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the driver -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick on how we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology .
you have to make it as much as possible .
and if you do that , you &apos;ll end up a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the implication that we need to ask us .
so unfortunately , the largest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we have to imagine the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it became very much about that that people think that the <unk> is the <unk> .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
in my opinion , it &apos;s involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- happiness , happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you , you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> . thank you ralph .
so i spent the last couple of years to put me in situations , which typically are very difficult and really dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i &apos;ve been working in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days that spent nothing like this to eat this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the largest part of my career that appeared in <unk> situations , and that &apos;s all about trying to study social and interesting , and hopefully , in a way , what you &apos;re doing for the audience and accessible .
so when i knew that i was going to come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard about that , a few weeks ago , a display in ebay .
i sent a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never got to buy this -- that chris anderson has never been able to buy a name that was going to be the issue .
so what you &apos;ve got was this : her name is presented here : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the issue is going to be , and who would go to the ears , and they could be stupid for the ears .
but even though , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
that &apos;s just the <unk> .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me a year before a year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say this with confidence .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;m going to go in some pretty awful situations in the course of the years in a couple of awful situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be able to go to something so hard and so dangerous as this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from top to the end , from the beginning to the end , from the beginning to the end to the end , the whole thing that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , which is the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be connected to the film .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to true .
it was &quot; in infinity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have a brand x for <unk> , but we &apos;ll be sure that we will sell every category in the film .
so we might sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car that they &apos;ve ever used to be , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that they &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , except to show that brands are part of life , actually , to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to help you do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to make them , but i think it &apos;s worth it in every case , some really well-known brands .
who knows if the film comes out , we might see how a <unk> <unk> .
what do you believe how the answer will be ?
the answer is highly likely &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing about the film or a hard thing about me ?
jk : both .
so ... it means not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about that brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people that they have to do it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a <unk> .
it turns out that it was reality , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
not to do something with the film .
i was stunned .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising is to present your product as many people as possible , it &apos;s so many people as possible .
particularly in the world today , this interface from new and old media and the <unk> media media , it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting <unk> , that the masses of this message is .
no , that was what i thought .
but see , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> errors , and that was the following .
no , that wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that would be no problem at all .
that &apos;s okay .
but what this image is , is a problem .
see , if you look transparency at the <unk> , this is one of the first images that seems to seem .
i really like you , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> , immediately , which is <unk> and the access to information , especially , which is <unk> -- the last line is certainly the largest problem .
you know , we currently hear a lot of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to it as far as it comes to be implemented , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is fear <unk> -- like this strange bear that still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what &apos;s still risky ?
a whole dish <unk> food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell a story .
we want to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father was caught me in lying -- and there he sits and look at this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s just a company that was ready to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i <unk> john bond , and richard <unk> for years -- i found that i had to deal with it , and i had to deal with my team .
so what they suddenly began to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to be understood , a <unk> problem .
i &apos;ve got friends , the big , giant <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends who do little <unk> as i do .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , say that the reason is why your movies are so successful , to the <unk> , that they have .
and then my friends who do little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we compete with this big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see you in the movie ?
whenever i put myself on the way , and whenever i open up the <unk> , you will see <unk> .
and every time i <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you all ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm up .
so maybe you should be a little of this <unk> . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be infected both of the men as well as women -- clear , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the <unk> .
now i can all answer your questions and give you a <unk> version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talk about these smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget as other brands .
so to do this stuff -- you know , remember people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what would you tell you ?
you &apos;re <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology : <unk> technology .
technology is not the way you want to describe something that &apos;s doing it under the <unk> .
we talk about <unk> , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category is really too much positive power , unlike &quot; fighting smell and humidity . &quot;
it takes you fresh .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i &apos;ve got to talk to the man on the road , which are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really love nice clothes .
and &apos; 80s <unk> hits on <unk> , except on <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style that i have , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many <unk> , and so a stuff .
but usually , i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry , and so this stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he probably would be a classic <unk> .
two : the brand that i am , is i would say , <unk> fly .
it 2 : part of the part , partly , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> throughout the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
that &apos;s my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the <unk> , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go in my head , somebody who really help me understand what &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called randy <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , helped to discover this <unk> .
if you could do it for that , they could help me .
you brought your pictures with your images , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit like that with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who make my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live in the world where you live around , the friends , the family , the way you live his life , the work and so .
all of these things come and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what is the next one you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
in which context is the thinking and emotions about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what does you do ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what do you do ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
what else do they have through ?
... that &apos;s not a fear . what kind of rollercoaster are ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for the patience .
yeah . so well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be .
there was a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea was that their <unk> two separate , but the <unk> pages have -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they turn it into something positive , and you can actually turn it into something positive .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , lots of small <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody would ask you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , how would you be ?
she &apos;s a <unk> ? are you something that makes your blood in <unk> ?
or are you more likely to do ?
are you something that &apos;s a little warm , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , <unk> , magic and <unk> .
or are you more like a <unk> ?
are you losing them and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they <unk> , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , stable , <unk> , secure , <unk> , <unk> , and the way the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and <unk> , and the &quot; no &quot; said , because she was not part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 <unk> who were willing to get up to the control of somebody who wanted to do with somebody who were doing with someone , and i think , to tell stories , which we typically couldn &apos;t have to tell -- stories that would never usually be in .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , so as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the brain , both to make advertising as well .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city for five years , there was no <unk> , no posters , no posters , nothing .
and we went to school in school , where companies are able to engage their way in southern schools , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects of which i received most of the feedback or where i had the largest success , those are where i &apos;m doing with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that they may not really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and do something completely different , something that people will think that our view .
and how was that for you ? what ?
well , since the film was going to be the <unk> film , we can look at this time .
so , according to <unk> , the first thing was in january , and since since -- and that &apos;s not once the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
that &apos;s actually just a period of two / two weeks .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to get too .
there is no time online . no <unk> .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not a project for a project where almost every <unk> that we were talking about , with their clients , the fingers to let .
and something that i believe is that if you take your chance to take risks , that they put risks in those risks .
i think if you go from it , you get closer to failure .
i believe that if you trained your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks to take risks .
we &apos;ve got to encourage people to have a fear of ways that they might be <unk> .
and finally , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
you welcome the fear . you welcome the risk .
a big taste full , so we welcome to risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it takes us a little honesty .
and it said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you can welcome transparency , &quot; you &apos;ve been presented by my good friends of <unk> , which is <unk> by ebay for ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world .
<unk> : &quot; they welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , this : what &apos;s going to happen with the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my bag , sent on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check from $ <unk> to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i made something else on google , and i &apos;m <unk> to do something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is today , i had the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and to explain access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education project -- i &apos;m not <unk> me -- but i had a lot of museums , and that &apos;s no access .
when i went to visit this museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to do this desire -- art needs to make technology together .
so we took a team , a great team , and we started this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demo , and you start to tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to go through .
you can look around in all these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get to two because it &apos;s very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is you in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and <unk> .
you want to pick up in the museum ?
open up the card and jump with a click .
in there you are , they want to go to the end of the route .
just further . much fun .
move around .
thank you , the best thing is still .
so now i &apos;m in front of a <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the image , click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all the world .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click here -- but i click it right now .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve made was called <unk> .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you .
you can get very easily and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is .
but then they &apos;re really deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and found that there &apos;s something there .
and i thought , &quot; well , it &apos;s interesting .
i went to close to close , and slowly slow out that these kids actually took something .
i &apos;ve worked a little bit about a little bit , with some known in met with some known in the met , and found out that it was a game called <unk> , which is a <unk> at a stick with a stick .
it seems to be very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to go to really close to it , you can go down to that .
just to give you the <unk> , i &apos;m going to see that you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is going on -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump quickly at moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
at the previous example , it went to find details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see , if you want to see , the van gogh of this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re <unk> in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in this image in my <unk> of this image until i really am in my <unk> .
this is <unk> , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot more , but i &apos;m missing time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , he &apos;s called collections .
everybody from you , everybody -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go back and create your own museum -- from all these images you can do your own collection .
very simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can send it all with <unk> , you can send your friends , and so a conversation start what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , is the main thing that all the wonderful stuff here are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not coming out of the museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be a digital medium with this digital medium , and they represent it online .
this is the biggest question that i &apos;ve asked to be asked to replicate the experience of a <unk> ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to put the experience .
that &apos;s how it goes . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain ; your brain can be <unk> in two camps .
that &apos;s half the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could make your brain .
for example , this one that is completely logical .
this is somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
well , where would you get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , which is in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both <unk> or so forth .
you can make sense and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people in common with most other experimental <unk> , which takes a good amount of logic to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition around the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love it with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then look like it &apos;s , and then we start to develop our intuition .
essentially , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve evolved over the years is probably that one thing is at the same time at the same time .
i mean , it can sound weird to think that one thing is at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve evolved .
and i remember to see a kid in the game .
he was still a nice and not very well , and he fell down .
but i bet he taught him to play a very valuable lesson , which is a very valuable lesson , because it &apos;s not easy to leave you , and they stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so they don &apos;t have <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with their particles , imagine all kinds of strange things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that they can be in two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was a few years ago , a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe a little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that &apos;s not like my intuition , and it may only be because i don &apos;t have so often playing with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean no one has ever seen a particle .
but my logical page doesn &apos;t like it .
because if all the things are made of particles and all these particles can follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just to follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it should not be that .
so i would feel very much better with the whole thing , if we could be able to show the rules of quantum mechanics .
so , a few years ago , i was doing this to do that .
i created one .
this is the first thing that you can see that was <unk> in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s a picture of the object .
so here i turn it something . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and here &apos;s a really very large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , it &apos;s like a springboard , and it &apos;s over the edge above .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool and the thing .
this thing has this thing that has the ability to be in <unk> <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full browser ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i &apos;m doing all kinds of weird things , but then another little strange stuff , but then other people go up and i hear other people , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects feel as well .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not only human beings , but also the light that seems to be , and the wind that &apos;s going to be over and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is <unk> , and we had to have the whole <unk> out of <unk> .
and we did that .
we turned out the light off , put it down in a vacuum and <unk> the whole air , and <unk> it up until almost to it , in the elevator , the piece of metal was free to behavior as it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found it &apos;s really strange moving .
instead of being quiet , it &apos;s just true , <unk> it . the way it was <unk> , like this -- like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could put it to the same time , and not to vibrate -- something that allows in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and not right ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms from which the piece of metal is still silent , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
it &apos;s just to <unk> <unk> voices .
the rest of the time are they <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places at the same time , which is the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
that was a value for all of this year in the clean room , because , check that , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom in the same time in two different places can be , this piece of metal can be two different places , why don &apos;t you do ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so , imagine , imagine you would be at the same time in several places , how would it feel like ?
how would you deal with your mind that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another point in history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box , we saw that the piece of metal is always in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in reality is just <unk> objects that are in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there is more than that , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to be able to think about economic development .
it should be our goal , if families think about where they want to live and work , they want to pick up between at least a hand full of different cities that all in competition are all in competition .
at the moment , we &apos;re far from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to be able to say it would be <unk> .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than it costs .
so we could make the world very simple with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
it may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
now , they &apos;re just going to share it from apartments against cities .
imagine half of the people who want to do in apartments , did this already , the other half of them don &apos;t do .
you could try to extend the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you were going to do , in those apartments , and their environment , law to avoid able to avoid , and from <unk> .
so it turns out to be a very hard one of all these cancers .
but you could go to a completely new place , which is a completely new place where the laws would be able to support a building , and it wasn &apos;t .
so i proposed that governments can create new surfaces that have enough space for a city , and they gave them a name : <unk> cities .
and later , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a reform of reform .
they knew that every year you &apos;ve been leaving around the country , about the united states , <unk> in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could be able to stay in your country and do exactly the same in the world .
in this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens if we &apos;re a <unk> area of our country , what happens if we &apos;re just a message to the american message , a part of the american message , and if you want to work in the surface of these messages , you can do anything about canada or the united states . &quot;
in 2009 , in 2009 , there was a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , won <unk> <unk> in a lifetime , whose program both innovations , as well as <unk> promised .
he asked <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i was preparing myself to tedglobal .
in improvement , and through the study of consumers , i tried to try to reduce this complicated concept of the <unk> city on the essentially elements .
the first point is the importance of law , laws that determine that you &apos;re not allowed to do existing <unk> .
we pay new technologies , but for the progress for progress , we need technologies and laws , and they &apos;re usually laws that go to us .
in 2010 , a friend of 2010 sent the link to a tedtalk .
and he showed him <unk> .
they call me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s go to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in december in december of a hotels in miami .
and i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like a new york , and think that one area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , at a point when there was a break , he said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk actually turned into very simple form that a <unk> city is a place that is the beginning of <unk> land , a <unk> that defines the laws of the laws , and the people have the opportunity to live in either of these rules or not .
so i was asked by the president from the president who said that we have to make this project to make this project , and that this is important , and that this is the way we &apos;re going to go forward .
i was asked to be asked to <unk> , and i was going to hold a talk at the fourth and fifth january .
so i &apos;ve been given another thing with facts , which has a graph like this has been trying to illustrate that if you want a lot of value in a city , it must be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in <unk> .
in this airport alone , a area of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of this , if you want to build a new city , you want to start with at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 .
polite all <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
the leader of congress came on stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you very much for your talk , but could we look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down there , and they &apos;re playing the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the line of the line that there is a new city to get people new possibilities .
there would be the way to live in a city that would be in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also has new possibilities for leaders .
and the leaders of the government would be on the help of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could benefit from the laws of the laws , and we would support that everybody can actually trust the charter .
and the idea of president <unk> was that the sense of the <unk> of the world i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come up and build this city for many years , which could suffer for many years and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it <unk> a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , at the age of january , you &apos;ve voted in congress for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> control , which is for particular <unk> <unk> .
in a country that has just been a tremendous crisis behind that , congress was elected to a voice .
all parties , all <unk> of society , supported this .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be authorized twice by congress .
in february february , it became a voice at the second time .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and 24 of february , one delegation of about 30 <unk> of the world , which was most interested in the world that were most interested in the business of <unk> .
the place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban center that built in south korea in south korea as the urban <unk> .
everything you can see on this image was built within four years after it took four years to get it .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
there were already two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically looking at it , it &apos;s what we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> ; and they consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that &apos;s allowed to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered the supreme court to imagine , as trial for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
<unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even put any funding .
one thing , as you know , has been <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of businesses who would like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to live there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who tell you that they would like to live in a different place .
a million people left a year of latin america and go to the united states .
many of you are fathers who forced forced to be their families to make work , and sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to earn enough money to eat food and clothes .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes kids who are trying to find their parents and find their parents , in some cases , for a decade since a decade .
so what is it for a idea of thinking about this completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition in competition ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth worth .
my friends made me asked me to say , thank ted .
you know how many decisions you do on a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a survey with 2,000 americans recently , and the average number of decisions , which is a typical americans in a day .
and it was also a study in recently a study of ceos where they saw a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes that are trained with these ceo , and how much how much time they were able to make decisions that are associated with subjects .
and they found that an average ceo in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these subjects were , of course , of course , many smaller choices .
50 percent of their decisions have been met by nine minutes or less .
for about 12 percent of their decisions , she took an hour or more their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you &apos;re doing in the nine minutes to the one of the day ?
how do you think , are you doing the decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of our modern time .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise your raise , because i &apos;m blind , just your hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university at stanford university , i went to a very <unk> store , at least that he was really <unk> .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink <unk> .
i loved it to go to this business , but at a time , i asked me , you know , how does it never <unk> something ?
here &apos;s the oil .
they had about 75 different kinds of oil oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to visit one day to visit the leader , and i asked the leader , &quot; work this model , &quot; that they really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists , which was every day , and usually their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gait .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve got a little <unk> directly at the entrance to the <unk> .
so we put six different kinds of tastes or 24 different tastes , and we put two things , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : one , i would have more people going to stay and do <unk> ?
there are more people stand up when it was 24 , about 60 percent than if there were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we saw us in which the case of people saw a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the <unk> effect .
from the people who were born 24 , just three percent of a glass of <unk> .
from the people who were there when there were six , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of <unk> .
well , if you calculate it , the people bought six times a glass of <unk> who had been six to the choice when they had 24 .
now , you don &apos;t have to buy glass <unk> is probably good for us -- at least , it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> will be able to be able to be able to make us with very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it goes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial corruption save .
i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i &apos;m going to describe with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in which we looked at the decisions of almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> that was possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that gives you something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more choices have been offered that , in fact , the participation rate .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that gave two fund , had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that <unk> nearly 60 fund , the <unk> came to about the <unk> .
now it turns out that even if you &apos;re involved in <unk> , if there were more opportunities for choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more than the more possibilities they were available to you , the more likely to be able to pick it and fund fund .
and the more possibilities they stood up , the more they put their whole money into pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone recommend by people would be important , if you &apos;re well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three fundamental consequences with people who have to offer , and more choices .
they take the decision -- put it on , even if it goes against your own best best .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial decisions and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re doing more for things that they &apos;re doing a less happy , even if you make an objective better .
and the main reason for this is that we might enjoy this huge shelf full of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t choose the comparison and we can actually choose something out of the fantastic service .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and in various ways that they can just use in your business .
first of all .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that less is less .
people are always concerned , &quot; close . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
but in fact , let &apos;s see it more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be ready , and they &apos;re going to go back to the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go back , and then there &apos;s a increase in the technology , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , &amp; amp ; there is an improvement in <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble , the different head and <unk> species of 26 to 15 reduced , they experienced a increase for 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation corporation her 10 to the worst sell <unk> <unk> , she experienced that the profits to look at 87 percent -- a result of the two , the increase of the technologies and reducing it .
you know , the average <unk> today gives you any other products .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket in the world today is <unk> in the world today , and they just give them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now , in the world of <unk> , i believe one of the best examples that recently come on the market , how to make the choice of choice , was something that david <unk> is very much <unk> , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s been offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees now takes up on a <unk> part .
the ones who really want to make a choice will have 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people are often saying , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to just do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t <unk> them , you can &apos;t do it . &quot;
now , before we started now , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he was willing to offer all people in this audience <unk> vacation on the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i ask you to clapping them , if you &apos;re willing to take up gary .
okay . everybody who is ready to take gary &apos;s offer .
all of that ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
okay .
in fact , that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would expect it to be real real .
because the pictures they feel real .
what brings me to the second technology that allows you to deal with the problem of the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that &apos;s what these consequences will be felt .
why do people give people about 15 to 30 percent more than 30 percent more , if you use a <unk> or a card card .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you &apos;re doing it , it feels a little bit , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so we have a study in a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- employees who &apos;ve worked all for <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering where they were doing their participation .
and during this gathering , we &apos;ve got this gathering just as she was always , just to have a little bit .
the small thing we &apos;ve got to do is that we &apos;ve asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation around 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save , or a increase for four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for .
third technology : <unk> .
we can do better with more choices than more choices .
here , for example , this is a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that there &apos;s the <unk> up up in the top , and down in the northeast area , and the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines have to be high .
but you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to show you 600 magazines and put them into 10 categories or i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and then you believe that in 20 categories , you believe that i had given you more choice , and i &apos;ve given them to 600 .
because categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other means &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> , and the display on the right jazz is then clapping in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that on the left , jazz is jazz , and that , on the right side , is <unk> , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left side is jazz and the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something , not which is the choice .
and this problem , they often see if you look at the long list of all this fund .
who do you want to tell you ?
my fourth technology : premise of complexity .
it turns out we can handle more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we have to increase the complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
so let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the opportunity to make your car completely .
you have to make 62 different decisions to design their car .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choice they offer a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the cars -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , etc . four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order into the decisions .
half of the clients is going to be a lot of possibilities , 56 <unk> of the small possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the clients goes from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested you are .
if you use the <unk> on the decision , that means that you &apos;re overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find out is that the people who are going to go from many to the low <unk> , and always choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
go from the little choice , you &apos;ll stay on .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order to change the order of changing this information .
when i start with the simple start , i learn how i <unk> .
even though , even though you don &apos;t choose this stuff , i don &apos;t know anything about my preferences at the same way , it &apos;s still going to pick up me to that .
and it &apos;s also <unk> me in excitement about the big product that i &apos;m doing , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be with interest .
so let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques , which is the problem of <unk> -- close -- you &apos;re going to go out the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- do it real ; we can prepare with more categories ; we can prepare with more categories .
every one of these techniques that i &apos;ll describe you today is to help you help you manage the opportunity -- good for them , you can use it for yourself , good for people who offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in the choice .
and the more we are going to pick up , the better , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube , i look at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video are going to be <unk> , and then then that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so difficult .
but <unk> has allowed us to have all our creative activities , can be famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours , video is uploaded .
and again , there &apos;s only a tiny percentage ever , and they &apos;re looking at thousands of times , and so to the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he photographed before his house in the national park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like the video last summer was popular for the first time .
in fact , no viral video didn &apos;t want to do .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re looking at <unk> mountain .
he had a lot of <unk> .
and this video was actually sent in january in january .
what happens here ?
there &apos;s jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video was so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> gives us new and interesting things and show a big audience .
it &apos;s it <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> on <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and she didn &apos;t think we would have this conversation without talking about this video .
rebecca <unk> &quot; is one of the popular video .
it was seen almost 200 million times .
that &apos;s what the graphics saw .
just like &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; seems to be there .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , many blogs started to write about it .
michael j. nelson from the <unk> science theater was a first thing that made on twitter .
so important is that a person or a group of <unk> <unk> is a point of view , with a big audience , and that process is accelerated .
and then this community was formed by people who shared this big <unk> , and began to talk about it , and to play it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> from &quot; <unk> &quot; at youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a fit for every single week .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to be able to be part of this phenomenon -- either by using something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold it for nuts , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> , the four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats are looking at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that &apos;s in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there was there .
somebody made an ancient version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the ground , which made it from a stupid joke that we can all participate .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something we do .
who would have this issue ?
who would have had &quot; <unk> &quot; or rebecca black or rebecca black or &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what do you have to do with you can write in which that <unk> ?
in a world where every minute , two days video can be uploaded , just unique and unexpected <unk> , like that <unk> video .
i &apos;ll give you , i wasn &apos;t very interested in my friend , when i said a friend , i want to look at this great video , about a guy who was in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the <unk> , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t let you go to the <unk> .
because that was completely surprising and funny , casey was <unk> <unk> , and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that all leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the properties of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to the audience and in the audience .
as i said , one of the right stars -- justin beaver -- made his beginning to youtube .
no one must give your ideas green light .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as a owners of culture .
and that &apos;s not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not trying to make the media from today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about about a 10 minutes about about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness is living in the life of a four year-old girl , when she was talking about 30 years ago , her mom and her grandmother &apos;s five days , her mom and her grandmother &apos;s five days .
the story isn &apos;t yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still going together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burn his book .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a writer , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by oneness and freedom .
hold it in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , as he must say his life was a single waste .
the words , as long , his friends , <unk> .
he moved to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother has never forgotten me life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to do us , and we &apos;ve come through .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> <unk> on lake <unk> .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for you , life asked her a job : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely left to fail .
after a four four and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat on the lake , as <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear had been involved , rape and death .
as most adults , my mom was wearing a little <unk> .
in a <unk> , my sister &apos;s only my sister , and i , you know , and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the motors , the clapping of one wave on the bug , the long and empty horizon .
and i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came up many times , but from the <unk> of the men of the men on our boat , or to the <unk> of the motors , who didn &apos;t want six hours .
but i remember the lights on the <unk> coast of the coast of the coast , and in the young man , who died and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the flavor of the first <unk> , which was one of the men in the platform .
no apple ever did .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next one is about four women in three generations that are building together a new life .
and we went down to <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> , the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , their existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> .
the smells of <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> has been shared between people who had one thing together : they started new .
my mom worked on farms , then in a line line , in a <unk> , six days , double layers .
and it could be able to find the time to make english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and then we put into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for that , mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
two couple of <unk> for school , every to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to be six years .
and there were rare <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here , and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
home where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting for reconciliation , and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mom was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and heard the motions of our grandmother in the house .
my mom was suffering from the boat .
and it was my job to stay on every night until your <unk> would come to be able to get them .
she opened a <unk> , then a <unk> , and then he opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who are not <unk> , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , caught between two worlds .
loans and asked them .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian asian student , the <unk> demands on itself .
in the other , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of the violence , the <unk> and the <unk> .
but so many of the time , over the years .
and because of this aid , i became <unk> in my last year , as young <unk> of the year .
and i was going to go from a <unk> to the next one , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le le &apos;s <unk> <unk> by <unk> , now <unk> le le , refugee and social activist that was invited to talk about places that she never had heard , and in hospitals , their existence could have never imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine , and the comfort of the life of a unknown <unk> back -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who had the stories of their days , and they told the stories of their day and <unk> , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was as old as we had the boat .
no one was never one way .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; and isn &apos;t what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about <unk> and education , and the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more i spoke , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of you did what they loved , lived on the limitations of the possible .
and even though i ended up thinking , i realized that i could not be involved with a career .
there must be another <unk> .
and i saw at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a <unk> , a <unk> , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can be so easy to collapse in the <unk> , so easily , you can feel the assumptions of the environment .
so i &apos;ve gone enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not like you <unk> it .
the ways that didn &apos;t have been allowed to have been <unk> .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and <unk> .
so i gave my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not a <unk> challenge .
a year we had no cents .
at the end of one , i was cooking a huge three-dimensional soup that we shared .
we worked up to the night .
most of our ideas were nuts , but they were a few brilliant , and we managed the breakthrough .
i met the decision in the united states .
after just a trip there .
my hands again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time in which <unk> the social norm and the local wants the most important person .
life had not changed since centuries .
her father died briefly .
her mother moved them alone .
by 17 , she became the second woman of mine , her mother .
no support of her man , she was worried about a <unk> , by having him in court , and she was in her own case , and a greater <unk> than she won .
&quot; is not being a <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> , and i saw them on the other side .
i knew she had come to say .
my mom called me a few minutes .
a couple of days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around .
we told her stories and <unk> her that we were still in her .
and at midnight , the monk came up and said he had to close it .
my mother asked us to touch your hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she said it since today , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t put them out . &quot;
if there is a band in our family , it &apos;s going through women .
you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives , we would have come to the <unk> .
the defeat would be too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m going to think of the boat .
who would ever want one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave every wave , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the motors , the long horizon , which does nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , you could be able to make it safe , i would do it .
it &apos;s also a <unk> mother today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
is it all photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with his camera .
nevertheless , my interest in photography started when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 years .
i put it together with my former <unk> , but it was a little different , because the camera was the process in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera with a camera , the process ends up when you press on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more likely to go to photography at the right place at the right place .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , which is something that starts to start when the trigger will go .
photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> road .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and <unk> still a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i want to look at it as if you could have that , on a photograph .
the photos you have to think about a short moment to find out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about to capture an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what makes the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but finally , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and as it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we &apos;re realistic for realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three perfect objects here that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can put together , you can create something that looks still more three-dimensional than whether it could exist .
but at the same time we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in using photographs .
it &apos;s really just to combine different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we &apos;re not thinking about , the things around us .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise , you &apos;re just wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow , to get a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that connected photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , the same thing should have the same <unk> .
and these two pictures meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s about being able to make it impossible to tell you where the individual images start and end up by taking them together .
does it impossible to say how the photo was actually made .
so , by taking color , contrast and light on the edges of the single images of <unk> , photographic <unk> , such as <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we can look at the limitations between the various images , and let &apos;s look like a single photograph , even hundreds of layers can contain .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the lower part was manipulated .
but this image is completely composed , from photos of different places .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go back to the ideas in his head .
but it requires much planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to try to find the different places for the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the shore comes from another place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house on the island of red <unk> to let it look at it .
so to reach a <unk> result , it &apos;s going to be seen from me in planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of all here .
and if you make good footage , it can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so it &apos;s all tools there , and the only thing we &apos;re limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you why so many electronic electronic <unk> failure .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patient .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced in the <unk> , was a <unk> .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific -- she represents a cup of coffee or tea , and you ask the patient , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> failure : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she has a button , on a / .
and every morning i get on .
and yes , i have a job for you to see .
i have my job for 95 pounds .
it &apos;s very simple : every time i get on the scale , you send my data on google health .
and there you &apos;re going to get out of my <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> lies , and it &apos;s not just in the moment where i have <unk> support , or that &apos;s also a look at the past .
but there &apos;s another thing .
maybe you &apos;re known , i have about 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning , i &apos;m going to get on my <unk> , and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch , i prefer a little lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but that &apos;s the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used to smoke .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and they get them to play some kind of game to control their health better .
the next week comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> , you know , a iphone or so <unk> .
and it will enable people to measure your blood blood pressure to take it to your doctor and send it to your doctor , to share it with something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patient &apos;s game , you can &apos;t just take the control of the control , the captain on your own ship , but we can also be able to help our health care of the challenges that are in front of us , and the <unk> of the health care , twice twice , and so on .
do you do methods that are easy to use , and start to hug it with this to hug patients in the team .
and they can reach through such ways , but also by <unk> .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phone .
we know exactly where all 20 machines are around .
we know one where all the gas stations are .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where about the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next potential <unk> was in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve been doing <unk> in the netherlands .
we built a website , and a <unk> asked asked , &quot; if you can see a <unk> , please share us where he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he was closed , of course , it &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> had been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for that .
and we &apos;ve designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve evolved an app for <unk> , extended reality , to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and somebody <unk> , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you also find your <unk> to find the next <unk> of life .
and by today , we don &apos;t just want this as a <unk> , as the product is called , but also as <unk> .
and we want to bring this in a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , which is to help us behave like <unk> , to challenge these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation , you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s your own blood , or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies are going to help us to help this <unk> .
this could be <unk> , or technician , for example , for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> still is still in its place .
please help us and try to improve health , not just better , but to take it into your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and i want my little <unk> that we &apos;re going to force us to change .
... it &apos;s <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh , a moment .
it might take until it is .
well , we can just skip that -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to take the star in technology and design to take a year of time and work in a environment , which is so pretty much anything you &apos;re doing , we &apos;ve got them in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little like the <unk> for america .
we choose some climbers every year , and we &apos;re doing it with <unk> .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and there was great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show is what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so they make al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
this looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who <unk> him when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows he &apos;s not very well in the <unk> when he &apos;s from a meter snow .
how did he come to look at this particular way ?
we had a team in boston last year in boston , which was called &quot; code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of february .
and they noticed that the city never <unk> these fire free .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were free to <unk> the world , right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can communicate a fire .
you <unk> it free to <unk> when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it off .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that was written in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do other <unk> .
it &apos;s expanding .
there is this guy in the <unk> department of the city , which has seen this app that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that this <unk> works , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle , seattle , to use the app to get the citizens to get the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced them to make people the <unk> , when it <unk> .
we know nine cities , the planning to use this app .
and it turns out very well , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know it doesn &apos;t usually go .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked last year in boston last year , for three people and a half months .
it was a way to find out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we &apos;ve been told that if it would go over the normal canals , it would have took over two years , and it would have cost two million dollars .
and that &apos;s still nothing .
now there &apos;s a project in the california &apos; right now , which is the cost to two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it turns out by <unk> , it &apos;s a kind of shot on the institution of government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think they should be .
and not even like a <unk> , it &apos;s more like the internet itself .
and that means free access that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly about this app is that you represents a new generation , which represents the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , and there are hundreds of people around the country that get up and write <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re awful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair it .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all of all your feelings and the queue of the <unk> , and all the other things forget that we &apos;re really concerned about , government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we can &apos;t do . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of these people , please ask you that you &apos;re doing about it , because things change things .
politics does not change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ended up their power from us -- <unk> you , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought it &apos;s mostly to choose people in office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the end of the end that it &apos;s mostly in south america .
this is the call for service and information .
there you &apos;re usually coming out when you &apos;re <unk> in your city .
if you &apos;ve ever got the chance to work in your <unk> call , as our fellow scott <unk> , as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all -- you &apos;re going to see that people who call the government for many different problems .
scott gets this <unk> .
he might be &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he &apos;s not really an idea . he begins with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open up all doors in your house and take a very loud music , and see whether that &apos;s livestock ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston has not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- it came in , &quot; <unk> , in my <unk> , can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott was <unk> by man .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went across there , the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yeah . <unk> ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , honey <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the current physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of a platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help yourself and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have to connect them with a national performance , if you were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and <unk> alternative to national services .
if a neighbor &apos;s neighbor helps to help , we make our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that is a input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is .
how many times we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going back to that , and then we expect the government , and then we &apos;re going to have a lot of change ?
that &apos;s because the government is a further ocean , and politics is the top <unk> .
and what it is below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt , which is this thing that we have , and we pay for it to be something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real thing is happening .
we &apos;ve got to get on the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
you &apos;ve seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of passionate citizens that wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is a answer to the <unk> of the <unk> to <unk> .
that &apos;s not a politically active , that &apos;s <unk> .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time to think about the world we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to achieve what we need to do , without making an institution that can do all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but that must be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible , the function of the government fundamentally <unk> in a way that can actually achieve something by making society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up on the <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things in common , you have to build it right .
now the average age of our colleague is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with your voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this battle that we all struggle to talk about who can talk about , you know , you know .
you can tell your opinion on every channel every time , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of the government , don &apos;t care about your voices .
they use your hands .
they use your hands to write applications that makes the work better .
and these apps , let &apos;s use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be a fire <unk> , a <unk> , a trash <unk> , a trash <unk> .
and sure , we could have these <unk> all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are how little digital memories are that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , they &apos;re controlling , they &apos;re controlling .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government to improve the citizenship .
so the question that i &apos;m all here for you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , all together , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
typically , my role is the role of explaining people like wonderful the new technologies that are on the emergence , being on the emergence , and i thought , because i &apos;m here in my friends , i would tell you what &apos;s going on with this incredible <unk> , and also trying to see what &apos;s going on that we can &apos;t be able to get up with this incredible <unk> .
i &apos;m going to start to show you just a single thing to show boring slide .
... could you just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve selected by my <unk> .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but in fact , the general form .
this slide shows data from a analysis of us about the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide is , like some other different , which we &apos;re often living in our field , a way on a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty thing that we need to use this type of <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could go back the light again .
even a little bit , because i &apos;m going to draw the same thing on paper here .
well , why do we draw graphs in the technology on <unk> curves ?
the reason that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , that &apos;s the years of the years , so the timeline of a way , and this is a chemical amount of technology that i want to show with a graph , it &apos;s silly .
so you look at this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;re going to say a <unk> , and then this would be very <unk> in the <unk> scale , in form of a flat line .
but if this happens , this is what happens , it changes the most important thing .
so if you would do the <unk> as fast as the <unk> process , then we could get <unk> into a cab and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was still never before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , through which the order of a few years increases exponentially .
so the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you see , you don &apos;t go ahead .
it &apos;s not possible that everything else is always evolving for forever and forever .
there are two possibilities .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> like this to get something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s a way .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really so , then that means we &apos;re in the middle in the middle right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world , to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i &apos;m also going to ask myself , is what this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we &apos;ve got a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
further than we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future of every year , the future is since i &apos;m in this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that there is something that &apos;s happening .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense of trying to try to try to see 30 or 50 years in the future , because it &apos;s all so different from what we &apos;re doing now not make sense .
so i want to talk about what that could be , this transition in which we &apos;re right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to go back to a step back and look at the thing on a little bit .
and i &apos;m going to look at this on the <unk> of the earth .
i believe the picture makes sense if you put it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and we go back to a half billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you &apos;ve been organized the way that these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good image about how they <unk> it .
i think there &apos;s theories that start to understand how anything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little story about that , which is this time little <unk> , which is different kinds of <unk> of chemicals .
some of these <unk> had a special combination of chemicals that allows you to integrate other chemicals from outside and so grow .
everybody who were so was , started .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but they were not about living in today , because every one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they have <unk> chemicals into more different amounts .
so everyone was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> , which has been the growth of the growth , faster than others and integrated more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
so these tend to survive longer , and it &apos;s in <unk> extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interestingly , it &apos;s interesting , if this <unk> learned a trick .
in fact , there &apos;s a way we don &apos;t understand the ability to learn the ability to learn information .
they &apos;ve learned the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , you have found the evolutionary way of a way that allowed them to make <unk> what they were , so that this information could stored and copied .
the amazing thing about that is that this kind of information is going to store over the time of 2.5 billion years where they came up .
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same two .
and every living creature , they &apos;re using exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re in the point that we can be able to be able to write yourself in this code .
and i have 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i try to keep in airports .
in this -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is from normal letters that we use to the <unk> -- and i have written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i &apos;ve got enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s exactly here .
would i have been a <unk> in reality , and then i would have written it on a virus and <unk> into the room .
so what is the next step ?
the <unk> of the dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , a very interesting step where things were completely different , and that &apos;s what these cells began to communicate and communicate information , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s also why , for example , it grows into antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay from penicillin , and they have this information together with other bacteria together in the dna , and now we have any amount of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate each other .
so that communications allowed this communication for communities , which was in some sense in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they &apos;ve either survived together , or they went together under . that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community became more more and more by evolution .
so the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to that communities that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community in a <unk> .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we &apos;ve got <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which are actually growing together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked on yourself .
your skin cells are useless without cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so forth .
so , these communities started <unk> , so that the level of which evolution was happening , no longer the single cell was , but the whole thing we call organism .
so the next step was happening in the communities .
the <unk> started to do information .
and they developed special structures that made nothing else to do as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> , which has built this <unk> .
they started to train specialists in the community , special structures , which was responsible for learning , understand , and that allows information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this was an evolutionary benefit .
because at that point , an individual -- learning is happening in the time of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary time .
so an organism could learn to eat a certain fruit , because she didn &apos;t eat bad , and she made him sick , the last time he ate it .
so this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas thousands of thousands of years were needed to be learned by the individuals who died because of those fruit died , there are not there .
so the nervous system has this particular <unk> , because evolution could happen in a individual place .
it could happen within a period of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention if you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically <unk> sounds of sound from me to create a similar <unk> idea in your head , which has a certain similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , moving it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the minds of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did is we &apos;ve done , we , the humanity , is we started to do .
we &apos;re going to go through the same steps , which has gone through , the abstraction of our methods , as we put data , to process data .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth , all our special mechanisms we built in our community that we have built this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also it &apos;s able to grow faster than we were so far .
so today evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a little bit of <unk> little <unk> where he showed a little evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> again .
the first steps of the story , which i told you is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so forth , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process is <unk> by itself , and so i think , i think , <unk> is the word for that -- if something gets its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
so we see the process that &apos;s going to live from itself .
i live in a living group of computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i &apos;m using using computers , not even , without the recently done progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in <unk> .
it has billions of those .
what i &apos;m doing instead , and what the designers of thinking about thinking , is we think of a conscience , we &apos;re thinking about a conscience , and the machine does something that could be far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do it themselves .
and they do it partly with technology that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used in the last time i &apos;ve been used in time is evolution itself .
and this is what we install a <unk> in the machine , which is happening in the <unk> .
so to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s designed by random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , please have a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
now , please all have this random elected instructions , all kinds of programs , and they finally choose the ones that i &apos;m going to be in the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to make numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for it .
so this is the programs that can make the most important numbers .
of course , the chance in random elected instructions is very small , that it &apos;s very small sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of kind of kind of get numbers , so i don &apos;t know the instructions .
but one of them may have two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , don &apos;t take those 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve come to be in the next .
every one , <unk> the rest .
now , all <unk> <unk> that are the numbers at best .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids <unk> the properties of the <unk> of the two programs .
so i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have been closer to what they &apos;ve come from .
say , &quot; please again this process . &quot;
<unk> them again .
maybe some mutations may be .
and try this whole again with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution over millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , a few hours .
and finally , i get programs that can get numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than every program that i could have ever write by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s odd and strange programs .
but they get the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that you do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because your life was going to get the job right .
and i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , he <unk> a card card and says , &quot; oh look . look at it .
there is , &quot; this airplane consists of <unk> <unk> , which together to work together to make your flight safer , &quot; do you don &apos;t <unk> ? &quot;
we know that there &apos;s not possible to be done if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to leave on computers , for a process , which is very different by classical engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal techniques to produce .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it yet .
so <unk> <unk> makes us technology .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computers much faster , so that we &apos;re able to make these processes still faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are going to feed themselves .
we raise up raise .
we &apos;re in a point , which is analog at the time , as a result of <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t make it very , what &apos;s the hell we actually create .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that there is something else .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we are the <unk> of evolution .
and i believe all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going next to be next .
well , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear right now before i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story begins here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that that has nothing changed since the time of ancient indian <unk> .
if we wanted to travel french at the time , we went into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we do that with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , taken out in the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera , and without tweet .
i found technology should be possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and in my idea .
and i came up with that , when we did our <unk> clocks and cameras from it .
they kept us by being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing magic .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to be able to connect the readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it <unk> images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
that storytelling , more senses .
but what do we do that ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here is , &quot; take your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here is , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and that &apos;s a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about this opportunity .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean that a magician , and i mean , it &apos;s the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found always quite exciting .
so you &apos;ve got to drop the ipad , and the fireflies <unk> .
and the light is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and so there &apos;s a book here every book , and every world is a little <unk> , which i &apos;m going to get here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> in the rest of the book .
it turns out to other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to go here .
it &apos;s important for me to do something that &apos;s important to do that <unk> is also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india are familiar with their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> had caught thousands of years in <unk> chambers in a old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story .
a story that &apos;s related to new issues like the <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their minds , on their computers , without coming out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world with their technology .
in a context of the book , you &apos;re sent to a quest . you &apos;ve got to go out and get out with the camera of the ipads , natural objects .
as a kid , i had heard of <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the kids don &apos;t make more .
this is going to be <unk> . you must go out to make a picture of a photograph of a flower .
in another chapter you have to tag a piece of <unk> and tag .
this is actually a digital collection of photographs that you can go online .
a kid in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkeys . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually did .
there &apos;s a huge amount of ways to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan a interaction where you use the video of the ipads , and by <unk> reality , you see a animation of <unk> , which seems to be a plant in front of the house .
and in a place , the screen goes with leaves .
you &apos;ve got to make the sound of the <unk> , and then you can read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the nature of technology come closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prison or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the socially <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there are very much australian .
and to be here at ted , to see and hear how powerful this is , i &apos;ve given a lot of power .
in the short time here , i became a clear one : ted has a identity .
you can say things that are the world .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and force that didn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a best meaning , but that &apos;s particularly meaningful teacher .
as a doctor , you can do good , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i &apos;ve not learned it in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who was dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
she was also the most important differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as slaves .
she was born in germany , and the experience of slavery shaped their view very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up and <unk> me .
and she kept me so clear that i could hardly breathe . then they made me go .
one or two hours later , when i saw her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she said me again . if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she made me in quiet .
she was something that did that you &apos;re always going to be near .
the only issue was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins went around .
and i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and go into the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> , and i went on .
first , i thought that was a game .
and i looked at it , and i was smiling , but she looked very seriously .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came over to me . she took me on my hand and said , &quot; come on , <unk> . you and i , we must talk . &quot;
i remember thinking about it yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out with it , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise that you don &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to be watching you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , you know , you will always love your mommy . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mommy is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise with promise you &apos;re going to take care . &quot;
i &apos;m my mom , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next <unk> me , you will always do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise to me is , &quot; you can never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 or 15 , my brother came home , and he brought this <unk> beer with her sister and i went to the forest .
we &apos;re just <unk> around there .
and then he took a quick beer , and he gave my sister one , and she took me , and then they gave me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . do you just do . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do you do . today we &apos;re doing this , you know anything we do .
i &apos;ve got what your sister had , you know , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . do you just do . &quot;
my brother <unk> me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , <unk> , but what . &quot;
and then he looked at my face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to make you crazy because of the entertainment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother told all grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i should probably not do that .
this is perhaps going to be public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m <unk> that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say it &apos;s because identity is doing .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell the people around us to say things that they didn &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all your grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
my uncle died in <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these are the themes we have to care about .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1996 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are left on the world or with <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , it &apos;s fundamentally changing our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison in prison , in prison in prison , or with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles around philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in prison in prison , in the prison , or <unk> .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also going to be through poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they &apos;re treated much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , affects the result .
yet we seem to be happy .
an politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost it .
i find this interesting thing .
there &apos;s some <unk> developments there .
my hometown of alabama can give you the <unk> , if you &apos;re not being <unk> .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population will grow their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the rate of the civic <unk> will be so high as the <unk> of the population .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , which was convicted of children in jail .
in this country in our country , there are <unk> <unk> <unk> without energy .
we &apos;ve got a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we believe , because you taught it so that the real question is : has a human being to die for one of him ?
that &apos;s a very important question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : does someone make a death for death , but , we did it to kill it ?
i find this fascinating .
the death penalty in america defined by error .
on nine people that we &apos;ve executed is one that we &apos;ve got executed for innocent cases , the <unk> and from death death .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i find this fascinating .
we would never leave somebody with an airplane , if for nine planes , the <unk> .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have this right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;m talking to my students <unk> history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time at the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the second war war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
so these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking about , you say , we should stop to say that in history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> <unk> <unk> and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we did in the historical context .
we &apos;re all around .
we &apos;re always creating new tension and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to go to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> doesn &apos;t get to overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in that country .
i kept some talks in germany to the death death .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply pleased to hear . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death death .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
it was completely silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible to kill us for the systematic kill of people .
it would be <unk> from us , aware of people , and they <unk> people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how to feel like it was to live in a world where the german state of people would be <unk> , especially if there were a lot of jews .
it was <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re doing people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted against death , 11 times higher when the victims is black , and the victim knows that the body knows the body .
and yet there is these mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we &apos;re not dealing with these difficult topics , then the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities will be suffering from suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
it seems important to unite both .
because we &apos;re all talking about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to get in a complex world .
for me , the time for me is doing time , to think and talk about the poor , the <unk> that will never be at ted .
but think about a way that is in our own life .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also , we &apos;re so rational , so much we appreciate .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i think you &apos;re going to do is not just open up for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to deal everything . but what we needed most is hope to be hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of the core of what i believe is that you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get .
there &apos;s no way to do technology and design that allows us to be very human , as long as we don &apos;t see eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more from us when we didn &apos;t care about .
she will touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege to meet pink parks .
<unk> parks always came back to <unk> , where she <unk> two of their oldest friends , these older women , <unk> <unk> , who had organized the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women met , and they &apos;re just talking .
and then , a woman <unk> me , and then he said , &quot; <unk> , wife parks comes into the city . we want to talk about .
do you want <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what will you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and heard only .
it was always inspiring , so <unk> .
one day i was sitting there and heard these women , and after a few hours , the woman turned to me , and after a couple of hours , the wife parks to me said , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the initiative of same is right .
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
and i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get wrong .
<unk> , people want to help people who became innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in <unk> .
we don &apos;t want to eradicate <unk> <unk> without children .
we want something against the death company .
we want to reduce the number of death .
we want to eradicate <unk> . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then i put a finger in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore they must be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i believe that the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to make ways to ask us to ask these challenges : these problems , that suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
i learned some very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for anybody on the planet .
if somebody lying is not just a liars .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t know it , it &apos;s not just a plant .
even who kills somebody , is not just a killer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so <unk> , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not on the things that we develop , not in our intellect and mind .
and finally , a society is not measured by how they &apos;re treated their rich and powerful and privileged , but it &apos;s about how to deal with the poor , the foot , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the real amazing things that makes us .
sometimes i &apos;m going to balance the balance . a story .
sometimes i urge to do .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are doing our thinking , very important way .
i <unk> these kids that were convicted too hard .
i &apos;m going to go to <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s going to be as an adult dish .
then i ask me , how could this happen ?
how do a judges turn into something that it isn &apos;t ?
the judges look at it as adults , but i see a kid .
one night i stayed too long and thought , my god , if a judges can turn us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judges has <unk> .
you should want you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started to work on a bed .
i had a <unk> , poor black boys as clients .
and i started doing this . the headline said , &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black clients like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
in my bed , i explained that errors of the <unk> and the police and <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , nothing more <unk> is that there are only error .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i had this crazy <unk> , or he was actually written .
and to my shock , i didn &apos;t just written him , but i was sent to court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to put in the dish , and this crazy case .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the dish .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
and finally , i went from my car , and i went down the staircase .
when i was the staircase to the dish , there was a older , black man , the janitors in the dish .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
and then he put him into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i must say , there was the power .
it touched something quite deep in me , identity , the ability every single thing to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judges saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you put this crazy opera ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
and more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written this crazy stuff .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry is that we were angry about skin color , about poverty , over inequality .
i saw the janitors , i saw the janitors and go down .
he always looked around the window , and he could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on .
and finally , this older black man came up with a very <unk> <unk> , and she sat straight behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , the judges announced a break .
and during the break , there was a <unk> in it , which was the janitors in <unk> .
this <unk> ran across the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood on . he looked at the <unk> , then he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m looking at this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes .
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far <unk> , but it &apos;s the justice .
we &apos;re not completely designed as humans , unless we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our survival are survival with each other .
that we have our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who can just see , just say , you don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give it on .
you &apos;ve seen a obvious wish in this audience , and you &apos;ve heard a obvious wish to help you and do something .
what can we do yet ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s about , actually a effort to businesses , something from the <unk> <unk> , which is in politics .
here in california , for example , you &apos;re going to be a billion dollars in the next five years , a billion dollars a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all <unk> don &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> .
56 percent of all <unk> come out .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this <unk> will propose to invest money into more <unk> and security .
i think everywhere there is possibilities .
so during the last three decades , the <unk> in america &apos;s massive .
this is a lot of a relationship in a relationship with the elevated <unk> .
what would you say somebody who believe that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> has not changed .
the majority of the <unk> in this country was not really in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic amount of numbers come into prisoners .
we have <unk> from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , the people for all behind grid , for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft , rather than that you force them to go to the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people , the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i believe that our current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you really have an string string here .
they &apos;re a inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
it &apos;s the death of death , an increased <unk> .
two : famine in somalia . three : spray of police .
4 : increased <unk> . are five : dangerous <unk> .
6 : social decline . we have seven : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> .
various different speakers : <unk> . <unk> . tornado .
recession . standstill . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it would have been collected for the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative themes , because our minds are doing exactly these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for it .
every second , every second , our senses are going to be much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival is the first visit for all the information that &apos;s part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our <unk> , our <unk> .
it <unk> all the information around the quest for all <unk> of risk in our surroundings .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to think about negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it <unk> , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , that &apos;s seven days , the week , 24 hours on the day of all this negative news , it &apos;s no wonder we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s no wonder that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s reality .
maybe the enormous progress we &apos;ve done in the last century that we &apos;ve made through a series of forces , so much that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , water , water and <unk> -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we &apos;re a lot better at the very long time , and they finally go through to overcome .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can have the development of evolution .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has been <unk> , which is <unk> .
child mortality has a tenth .
and that &apos;s what the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and cost to have a lot less .
steve pinker has shown us that we currently live in a very peaceful time .
and charles <unk> is the <unk> in the last 130 years of 25 percent of 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations .
in fact , we &apos;ve defined poverty .
remember that a lot of americans who live under the poverty poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and cars .
the richest <unk> of the last century , the <unk> of the earth would never have been able to come out like that <unk> .
the basis for a lot of these are creating technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to come up to information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and it &apos;s all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone is about a million times less and less thousands faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
one of the time you &apos;re seeing -- in good things like in bad times , war or peace , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
they slow out for none of our big problems .
also , despite your logarithmic <unk> on the left side , she &apos;s coming up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are all available .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that call my friends in autodesk , &quot; <unk> , &quot; we call sensors and networks , robot , 3d printer , which allow to democratize the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> biology and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer watson .
that was great .
i was looking at the papers , and after the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would give every owner of a <unk> .
four years ago ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m at ted at ted , which is a new university , called university university .
we bring our students all these technologies , which is special focus on how those can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and service , who can make a lot of life in a decade that can affect billions of people .
think about that a group of students today can affect the life of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can compare to dozens of companies today that have done this .
if i think , i think surplus , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making a half goods of abundance .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resources .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the king of <unk> was got <unk> .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more times as gold and <unk> .
this is the reason that the dome of the <unk> was made from aluminum .
although <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> gets , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
it &apos;s <unk> by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed , and then this is so cheap so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with <unk> more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> every <unk> minutes on the ground .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost for a 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar <unk> was 50 percent .
last month , this was published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states of solar solar six cents a <unk> , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , then we &apos;ll have water in the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , when carl sagan was the <unk> of 1990 , when it was at saturn , was back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue center . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting for 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean <unk> , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and you may have heard about the size of a <unk> .
it can produce a thousand gallons a day from different sources a day -- whether seawater , clean water , mountain -- and all that for less than two cents a gallons .
the head of coca-cola has just been able to start a big <unk> with a hundred units in developing countries .
and when it &apos;s good , and i &apos;m very confident , and then coca-cola this technology will apply to global countries on the entire planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there is today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phone .
you know my god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
think about that one <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look at google with your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communications in the surplus , as no one could have ever predict .
and it &apos;s still better , the things that you &apos;ve spent , and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photo , libraries of books and music , is literally <unk> and cheap in your cell phone .
and the best thing about this is perhaps what &apos;s going to be in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , which is called &quot; $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize x prize .
we ask teams around the world , all these technologies together in a cell phone can be able to talk to the device that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s related to the ai , you can test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , it has to take a better diagnosis than a team <unk> doctors .
imagine this device , in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the health workers in the health care .
if this device was a <unk> or <unk> sequenced that is not known , it &apos;s not known to you and stop a pandemic in front of your outbreak .
but now for the largest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines stand for population .
we just have the <unk> .
and only by the way , the largest <unk> against a population population is a better upbringing and food in the world .
in 2010 , we had just been connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we go from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication will join .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of a standstill , i see one of the largest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the <unk> , and they &apos;re getting better through the <unk> , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d printer and to use a lot more more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> ?
how about a sentence of new , never before <unk> voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to make change and make change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people will bring ?
how would it be <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus on , extraordinary things can create extraordinary things and governments only could do in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that may be already familiar .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s solved by this .
it was developed at university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so it was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university , etc .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people that play the game online .
and it showed that today is the human pattern pattern , the proteins are getting better the proteins .
and when those people came up and looked at who &apos;s the best <unk> of the world , it wasn &apos;t a <unk> , no <unk> , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman , the day of the day , the best <unk> of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me tremendous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals to ask us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online for the new challenges , and to do that , what needed to do .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical student , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m very long enough in the business , as i can allow it to give me a piece of my own <unk> <unk> to enable this .
but before i go to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the <unk> close and move to the world world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems to seem to seem to look at statistics and to use this to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to take some statistics from that i hope most of you &apos;ve heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about a 300 , if you &apos;re talking about a bat .
that means that the player &apos;s secure three of 10 beats hits .
this is called the ball into the <unk> , he &apos;s going to come up , he &apos;s not caught , and who tried to go to the first base to the first base , it hasn &apos;t been able to throw it on time .
three from 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s one of the rest of the rest of the rest of four .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player was met during a <unk> season .
let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less than i talked to you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and they &apos;ve got a beloved people with <unk> <unk> , and their <unk> <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> , which is the <unk> at 200 .
but , do you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better . she &apos;s on the <unk> .
and it &apos;s an <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , to be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor or <unk> .
but what we &apos;re doing though is that we put each of you to put me in the world to be perfect .
you don &apos;t have a mistake , no one does , but no one is doing the details of how that &apos;s supposed to be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
i was a serious <unk> student .
in high school , a peers said that brian would learn for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters at the toronto at the toronto of general hospital .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and <unk> every <unk> , every stick of one of a artery , which is <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the time , i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew all of you knew everything and everything knew , or at least as much as possible , i could be immune against that errors .
and it worked for a time , until i met a printer .
i was <unk> in toronto , and i was brought into toronto , and i was brought in toronto in the hospital .
at that point , i was the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission , as the <unk> <unk> advice to investigate the <unk> .
and feedback on my <unk> .
i studied a little woman printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i asked her , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , who told me that she suffered under <unk> failure .
this is a condition in which the heart failed , instead of pump the entire blood on the lung , and it turns out a part of the blood cells in the lung , and they put them down , so the <unk> came up .
and that was not a hard way to diagnosis .
and i asked them and made me to treat .
i gave her <unk> . i was having to take her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i &apos;ve got your medicine that we call <unk> , water , so that they &apos;re the liquid .
and over a period of a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistake ; i sent them home .
in fact , i did two errors .
i sent them back home without my <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t take it on , and i did what i should have had to have a call in my <unk> , so he had a chance to make a own image .
and he knew it was able to have extra information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was like this , and so i would be able to worry about my patient without doing it .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home , i <unk> a silent voice in me who tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do it not . &quot;
in fact , it was so very much to me that i asked the nurse that i asked the nurse , which was around a woman printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s right when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it , and the nurse said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go . &quot;
and i remember when it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> , and they brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day , i put my stuff , which was the hospital , and went to the parking lot to go home with the car , when i did something that i couldn &apos;t do .
i went home through the <unk> on my home .
and there was another nurse , and he said , another nurse , he had seen the sister who had seen a little printer , but another three words that i &apos;m afraid to do .
other doctors fear that as well , but the <unk> is very special because we &apos;re just able to see the patient .
three words loud : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient who was going home ? &quot;
asked the nurse <unk> .
&quot; so she &apos;s going back , &quot; she said it in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after that she came home , after i sent her home home , she was sent her home , and the family called <unk> , and they brought them back to a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
they hardly hardly and was blue <unk> .
the <unk> moved all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they put them to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was in the inside .
and i was through this rollercoaster , because she came up to the <unk> , and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days , that she was never going back again .
she didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
your family was <unk> .
and over the course of eight or nine days , they built the <unk> .
on the day , she <unk> you -- wife printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you tell you that you never forget the names of people .
and that was the first time i learned this .
so the next few weeks , i &apos;m looking at that , and i &apos;ve got the first time for the first time that we &apos;ve got to shame that in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you don &apos;t speak with the colleagues .
you know all the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend price , although this one on <unk> <unk> , and then you get a terrible discussion and a terrible discussion , and you know , in the end , you have a terrible discussion , and you get a terrible discussion .
if you do <unk> , and you never do it again .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
i &apos;m talking to the most i &apos;m talking about is that that makes a <unk> sick .
it &apos;s the one that says it &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason of my <unk> , he was very happy .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be sued .
but i asked these questions .
why did i didn &apos;t ask the <unk> ? why do i do you home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i in medicine ?
but it &apos;s very slow .
i started feeling better .
and then in a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up , and i might say i could feel better .
and i was that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again a mistake that could <unk> the voice .
and she did it .
and i went on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had a service in the <unk> in a <unk> hospital in north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 years old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot go and i was in a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked in the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed him on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me a conversation in your office .
and she said three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he was a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , it &apos;s the top of the <unk> , and that causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
and fortunately , he died .
he got <unk> <unk> , and it recovered a few days later .
and i went back to the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , made me open up and went back to work and over again and over again .
in a <unk> , i have two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of things that you &apos;ve heard about , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i don &apos;t sent it home , and there was no one in your treatment .
and in a way , i had <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> the <unk> of the kidneys , and when that was without <unk> , my colleague , my colleague , in the bottom of the patient , was stuck in the bottom right and called the <unk> .
the other had had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues to be able to know it .
and he did and when he was a <unk> in the right bottom sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was good .
both cases <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , which was a lot of my colleagues saying , but total nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , it and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not close to my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk to it , if i can tell the silent voice that could really find me , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my errors , so they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i had a room -- as well , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you talk about the last time you &apos;ve heard about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and there you want to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to talk somebody about your own errors .
if i had a room full of colleagues , and to ask your immediate support , and ask them to tell you what i &apos;ve just told you , i wouldn &apos;t get the end of the second story before it would be really awkward , you would get the issue and forget the rest .
and in fact , when i knew , or my colleagues knew that a <unk> in my hospital in my hospital someone would have lost the wrong leg in my hospital , and then you believe i had problems in the eyes .
this is the system where we live .
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who are doing errors , and those who are doing that , and those who don &apos;t do . those who can do with bad results , and the <unk> results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies to attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re doing those who are doing the errors of medicine , that is a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical <unk> and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study of medical errors and wrong treatments for all of me for one of my first article that i was doing for the toronto star , i wrote , to learn .
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day we &apos;re going to happen in which one of the 10 <unk> is either a wrong or wrong or wrong , which is always going to be more , and it will be higher or dead .
in this state , you &apos;re going to die about 24,000 canadians .
in the united states , the institute of medicine , the number of 100,000 .
both are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> in which the medical knowledge , every two to three years , we can &apos;t go up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive errors , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> , and i &apos;ll give you a little bit <unk> breath , and suddenly the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same time .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patient are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me your symptoms in the same way .
all of that , they &apos;re inevitable .
so , if you take the system so that i was taught it , and all of the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s no longer left .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black style , &quot; i &apos;ve got the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to anybody from <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , , blah , &quot; what do you show with the microphone . &quot;
and then you turn your girlfriend , you &apos;ve come down with your head , then look down , and you look hard , and start to tell your stories .
you want to tell your stories . they want to share your stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same errors that i <unk> . &quot;
what you need is a environment that <unk> them in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it begins with a doctor .
the new <unk> a doctor is a human , knows his humanity , accepted it , it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it can get everything from you to get on .
she shares their experience with others .
and they &apos;re going to talk other from their errors .
and they &apos;re seeing other their errors , not to <unk> , but in an intimate , supportive way that everybody &apos;s benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that is so , then people make mistakes of time .
so the system that the system is designed to make <unk> , which makes it easier to find more errors that people are inevitable , and it &apos;s also allowed to create loving spaces , to make things like that potential errors , and it &apos;s actually rewarded for people like me , the potential errors should be rewarded .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m a new doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i do errors .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best possible to get it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know he was <unk> here .
you like , you might think it &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he collected fish .
he described one of them as usual .
it was a <unk> .
until the mid- &apos; 80s , he was doing in great style .
now it &apos;s the red list on the red list .
this story , we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we &apos;re still coming on the galapagos .
we still think they were originally .
they &apos;re still described to describe it as a close .
what happens here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon was from <unk> , and from a couple of mangroves .
there was <unk> from about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were living good , and they were making <unk> in ghana .
when i came back 27 years later , the fish had been working on half its size .
adults , five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it &apos;s all changed .
my third little story told me from my <unk> at the introduction of <unk> in asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- in the beginning of the 1960s -- <unk> europe many <unk> .
<unk> , countries , who started to have 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing fishing , is called <unk> <unk> .
and i went to that , and we went out in the southern southern southern sea , and particularly in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially , the bottom of the sea came up , and then <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
within a year , you have a survey , and then you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is going to change . you know , in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will crap crap .
that &apos;s a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , you threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a alive .
she was not <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat it .
in fact , this mountain of every time is <unk> every time you &apos;re driving in areas that have never been doing .
but it &apos;s not <unk> .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our <unk> of the new level , and don &apos;t call us in memory , which was there .
if you <unk> it , this is what happens .
on the line , there are some good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of your country , the green .
with time , it changes . it changes because for people , they are , of course .
every generation is looking at the images that you &apos;re looking at in your mind life , as the standard and will get all of them .
the difference becomes a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses true .
it can give a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s actually our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared , or things that are not more like they were .
now you could think that the problem of people who are sure when they were living in <unk> societies , and they were aware of a few generations , what they did .
because there &apos;s obviously an animal that was very often not even rare before it .
so you don &apos;t have a very much natural animals .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it won &apos;t be a big loss .
the time we focus on the big animals , and in the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they become rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
at the time , little fish left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm a scientist , you know that it was really different .
you &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence , as you are in a former form , are not like that evidence would like to say .
so , for example , there is the anecdote that the report of a <unk> site that observed in this area of great <unk> , not being used , or not even <unk> , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this is the enormous big role that can play a <unk> .
because by <unk> , we &apos;re basically the past again .
so we put the past again that people can &apos;t understand because they have changed the <unk> and very low .
so the people who can see a marine map , and they can benefit from the insight that allows it to <unk> their <unk> .
what about the people who can &apos;t be possible because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west ?
here , i think , i think the art and the film may make the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why the people have been touched by that -- except from the <unk> , why were you so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s a little bit <unk> that left in a certain way .
so my one , the only one that i &apos;m going to give you , is about cameron , and he &apos;s called &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the &apos; 80s , the communist <unk> , you had to have had to have a typewriter , that in the government .
they also had to take a sheet of <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for this is : the government could go out where a text came from .
and they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of this mind .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much of the freedom would be .
in our own countries , we would never do anything .
but if you buy a new <unk> in 2011 , in 2011 , you buy a new <unk> of the leading <unk> and print a page , then this page is yellow <unk> on every page , in a pattern that makes the page clearly on them and your printer .
that &apos;s happening today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and that was an example , which is our own governments to do technology against us , the citizens .
and that &apos;s one of the three <unk> of these today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example here , this is mr. <unk> <unk> of <unk> in ukraine .
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to earn much money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
that &apos;s alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so forth and so forth .
so these people are online online , but they &apos;ve been made it illegal by having <unk> , which is used <unk> to claws while we &apos;re doing our <unk> , or also <unk> , which we &apos;ve collected on the keyboard , while we go through a infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency <unk> two months ago , the swiss <unk> of mr. sam &apos;s one , and on this case , <unk> million dollars than it was frozen .
mr. bless himself is to go to <unk> foot , which is unknown .
and i claim that it &apos;s more likely today that we become victims of a <unk> , as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will be even worse .
in the future , most crimes , most crimes .
the second one we can observe today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests about a opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over for the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become a <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so this is the three <unk> : criminals that are doing it for money , <unk> like anonymous , which is doing resistance , but the last group are nations , governments that are the attacks .
there are cases , like the <unk> .
it turns out what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last fall , it had to sign up <unk> , because <unk> was hacked .
somebody was hacked , and he had the system of hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the many of this group of the question , if he had been able to <unk> it for possible because of the <unk> people .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
well , how do people die in some of these things ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , you need a website with <unk> , with <unk> service , for example .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , quotations or one of your competitors , but these services are particularly spread in <unk> states like iran , where you know that the local government can &apos;t use in your conversation .
but can you , if you go into a foreign foreign foreign
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly the case of <unk> .
how does it happen to the arab spring and the things that are happening for example ?
well , in egypt , the headquarters in the april of 2011 , the department of egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a &quot; <unk> &quot; is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this <unk> , notes in germany , the egyptian government sold a few programs that they had sold to -- in a very large framework -- any communication of egyptian citizens could capture .
they had this program for <unk> euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments provide governments with <unk> governments , so that can make their own citizens .
but western governments help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago called <unk> , this was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you become a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s going to be pretty security to <unk> your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap into your internet chain .
they use means like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communications , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> <unk> .
so , if we go on these things on this stuff , then the obvious answer to people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we do today , in 2011 , our governments may trust , but every right we &apos;re going to get out of it forever .
and trust us , trust you blind to any future government , a government that we might have to have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to do the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> had been made <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> from cement , the fit .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they gave us to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially , the <unk> of our time has become the market building .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego that came out .
it was called &quot; automatically <unk> rock . &quot;
and within less years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be engineer to create nice houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego made it for all possible .
lego is essentially the <unk> , the building block of the world , took a building building for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year at bell labs , the next revolution went to the next revolution .
the transistor was a little bit of <unk> , which is from a world of static , <unk> blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
like the <unk> , allows us to build the transistor much bigger , more complex , a rock after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that that &apos;s not the building building of our time for experts , and therefore i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea , how to put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic <unk> that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
you can &apos;t put them wrong .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is a blue and a green one , and they can connect to a very quickly more <unk> .
they put a blue blue , and you can do light .
you can put a switch in and so they made a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> , which is here , and they made a little <unk> .
put this <unk> for a extra effect for a extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
over the simple play , it &apos;s actually pretty powerful .
instead , you have to code , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to program them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to slow it down , or slow down , you turn it up on this button , and he does it faster or slow down .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a <unk> rock .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve got <unk> to children , and you can see it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is how you start to understand the electronics that you can see in the everyday life , and they don &apos;t learn to school .
like for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or as an ipod to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought <unk> <unk> .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that began to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a couple of weeks ago , we brought <unk> to risd , and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- only box , wood and paper , and they said , &quot; what &apos;s what &apos;s doing . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-dough that has fear in darkness .
for this <unk> , <unk> was another material , electronics became a different material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so <unk> open source .
you can go on the website , all of <unk> silk and they make yourself .
we want to encourage the world of the creators , the inventor , <unk> , because this world where we live in life , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , you go down and start to invent it .
thank you .
