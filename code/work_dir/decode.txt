you know , one of the great <unk> in the journey , and one of the joy of <unk> research is to live with people who still can remember the old days , which are still feeling on the wind , and touch them off from the rain , touch in the bitter sheets of plants .
and just knowing that <unk> still travel beyond the milky way , or the importance of myths the elders of inuit , are also full of meaning , or that in the himalayas the buddhist always track , is the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the idea that the world of anthropology is calling to memory , that &apos;s the idea that the world , in which we live in to memory , is the idea that we have .
and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to be <unk> by death , and so we should not surprise we all singing , dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a matter of <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the warriors in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> of <unk> , or the warriors in the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara , and this happens to the colleague that i traveled to a month in the desert .
all of these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can only meet hope .
together , the <unk> cultures of the world are living a net of <unk> and <unk> life , which is the earth <unk> , and it &apos;s as important for the earth as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and <unk> , as the result of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and intuitions that have been generated by the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are , and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing species .
and the same thing that the biosphere was highly eroding happened with the <unk> -- only with even more speed .
a biologist would say for example , to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just before the extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> of the area of biological diversity -- that &apos;s almost very much what we know as an example of cultural diversity .
and the critical indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when any of you had been born in this room , we &apos;ve talked about 6,000 languages on the earth .
now a language is not just the whole of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that has access to the soul of a certain culture access to the material world .
each language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey here , it &apos;s not half the ears of children .
they won &apos;t teach infants anymore . that means , if nothing is done , it &apos;s actually already dead .
what could be more lonely when the silence is to be <unk> , one of the last of your people who talk to your language , you don &apos;t have an opportunity to give the wisdom of the ancestors , or to give the hope of hope ?
and yet , in fact , this terrible fate actually happens to someone on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , dies , an older man , and takes the last <unk> of an old language to the grave .
and i know some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if the world is not a better place , if we &apos;re all talking a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be yoruba , let &apos;s be yoruba .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly you see what it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk to your own language .
that &apos;s why i want to take you in a way to take a trip through the <unk> , a short trip through the <unk> , to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now , there are some of us who forget that , in a sense , that i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different ways of being mine .
so , for example , take this child &apos;s <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> from the east belly by holy snakes .
this is a people , which is not different between the colors blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest that people depend on .
they have a curious language and a <unk> called a linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
all of this roots in the <unk> past , which is curious about these big houses in which because of <unk> six or seven languages , however , is that you never hear a language .
they only hear and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first time in 1958 .
in 1957 , there were five <unk> contact and made a <unk> mistake .
they threw out <unk> photos from the air , which we would grade as a friendly gesture . and , in the process , these people from the rainforest in their lives have never seen anything .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the character or see the character , found nothing and <unk> that this is business cards and killing the five <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> were killing , not just asking the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we were tracking the <unk> eight generations , and we found two cases of a human death , and when we <unk> the people with a <unk> , they gave that one of the people was so old that he died , and we were killing him with the spear .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of forests that was amazing .
their hunter could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal species this owned .
i got a really amazing job in the early days of a really amazing task when i asked my professor at harvard , whether i was interested in walking to haiti , and the secret societies , which were the foundation of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the poison that was used for making <unk> .
so , to give a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of a world .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i ask you to ask the great world of world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> , whatever .
a continent is always left to be left , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there were no religious faith . of course , there was a very profound religious thought , and during the tragic diaspora of the <unk> diaspora .
but what &apos;s so interesting about it is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
they give the living to the spirits .
the minds can be <unk> by the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance , to <unk> the soul of the living , so that the <unk> will become a very bright moment to god .
<unk> likes to say , &quot; your white is going to church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take it from the mind . how can you do damage ?
let &apos;s see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal without combustion , is an amazing visualization of the ability to affect the body of the mind , to affect the body the way that it &apos;s being <unk> in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the <unk> from the sierra nevada of the sierra nevada of <unk> , the most extraordinary .
and in the aftermath of the old <unk> civilization , the caribbean <unk> of colombia , and in the aftermath of the conquest , the people moved into a <unk> <unk> massive , which is the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the <unk> .
to the day today , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , which i &apos;m training to the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the boys are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> at the base of the glacier for 18 years , in <unk> at the base of the glacier for 18 years , they chose to recreate the nine months of pregnancy , they &apos;re going to spend <unk> in the lap of a great mother .
and during all this time , it &apos;s culturally <unk> in the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers , and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , one day , one day , they &apos;ll be out of the outside , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sunrise . and in this <unk> moment of the consciousness of the first light when the sun begins in the abstract moment when the sun begins in the abstract moment , all of a sudden all of a sudden .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and whenever we think of native aboriginal and landscape , we either <unk> and have the old myth of the very fancy wild , which in his simplification is a <unk> thought , or on the other simplification , are connected to nature than we do .
so , native aboriginal people are not <unk> , they &apos;re not getting otherwise from the <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be a lot of place in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold <unk> of tibet , but they still have shaped a mysterious carbon dioxide of the earth , which is not shaped at the idea of being aware of that , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that earth can only exist , because it &apos;s going to be <unk> into human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means a little child from the andes , who grows in to believe that the mountain is a <unk> , which is or your destiny will be a very different person , and another relationship with this resource , or this place , as a little kid , that can be worn off .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor of which the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> columbia and believed that these forests are there to become <unk> .
that made me a different person than my friends , under the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> spirits , are in the <unk> of the world , ghosts that they would participate in their <unk> .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph that i just took it last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful <unk> preparation for the repertoire of <unk> .
what &apos;s so fascinating is not only the most important potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s actually made of two different sources , and on one hand , there &apos;s actually two different sources , which is a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so it &apos;s a <unk> smoke .
this plant contains a couple of very strong <unk> that serotonin , <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , you saw this stuff , this substance that they create from various species also .
that powder is sort of like <unk> from a <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it becomes no distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who has started the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , talking about it , talking about this <unk> , and i said , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you know , to experience a <unk> .
but the thing about <unk> is that it &apos;s not going to be taken <unk> , because it &apos;s a human gut with a human gut , with <unk> , <unk> .
they can only be taken into connection with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now what &apos;s fascinating is that the <unk> that contain in <unk> are <unk> of exactly the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> , so you ask yourself .
how can these people come out of 80,000 species of 80,000 species of 80,000 species of 80,000 species to find these two <unk> plants that are combined in this way , a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole larger one is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and mistakes , which it turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians saying , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , <unk> , they have 17 variants in the woods that can see all of them at a long distance in the forest that seems to be a way .
and then you ask them how to justify your <unk> and say , &quot; i thought you understand some of the plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each one of the 17 varieties at <unk> , and you sing them in a different <unk> .
well , that doesn &apos;t get you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than count .
now , the key thing is that , even those of us , the sympathy for the difficult position of native americans , they have to look as a <unk> and <unk> , but they &apos;re kind of looking at the past , as the real world , to accelerate our world .
so the fact is , in the 20th century , in 300 years , not for his wars or technological innovation , but rather than an era where we were in place , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth is either active and cultural diversity on earth .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> heard not to be less in the sioux , when they were bow and the arrow of the americans stopped when americans stopped being americans when they stopped doing .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you look around in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the demise of the extinction , and these are <unk> living peoples that go through <unk> forces that go through its capacity to <unk> forces , whether it &apos;s <unk> across the capacity of the <unk> , whether it &apos;s been <unk> in front of its capacity in the forest .
or if we go to the hills of tibet , where i &apos;ve been researching a lot of work , you will see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of human beings , is convicted of people , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle of human beings , isn &apos;t just convicted of the lives of human beings , but generally <unk> and <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering <unk> if you haven &apos;t experienced it at a <unk> level .
i went back to a young colleague , 6,000 miles away from <unk> <unk> , through <unk> , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of you , and that &apos;s turned into rubble and ash . 1.2 million people who have been murdered by the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant it was killed immediately during the chinese invasion .
his uncle , with their holiness in the diaspora , brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for -- to be wealthy .
he was going to go into jail at the age of two , to hide under her <unk> , because they couldn &apos;t live it .
the sister that was doing was actually <unk> into a <unk> .
one day they stepped out on a <unk> <unk> , and they had to come on a <unk> for them for seven years .
the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really are in front of a choice . do we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist , said before she died , it &apos;s their greatest fear that as we see ourselves in a direction of a thread , <unk> , <unk> worldview , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole range of human imagination on a <unk> mindset , but we &apos;ve forgotten that there &apos;s ever been other ways to wake up on a <unk> .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed since 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of <unk> <unk> , <unk> the poetry of <unk> , <unk> , hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- found specialization , just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we are facing in the ensuing millennia .
when we ask these <unk> , after the importance of human beings , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song we &apos;re going to <unk> the possibility of what we are : human beings who are aware of the importance of all the people and gardens to thrive , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took at the north end of the <unk> when i went to the <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
and the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and over the <unk> of our domination , they were forced to draw in settlements .
this old man &apos;s grandfather refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold , they used to use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of the sledge were originally made out of fish that was made in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear off the arctic night or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out the outside , made his pants out of <unk> and <unk> into his hand , and when the feces started cold , he formed it into the form of a <unk> .
and he got saliva on the sides of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog , and he <unk> a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog , <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a different dog on the top of the house with the belt .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and this is a symbol in many ways a symbol of the inuit and all the native people in the world .
the canadian government , the canadian government gave the complete control of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home country , called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for people with their people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are going to be part of our own children , part of the geography of hope .
now , at national geographic , what we &apos;re trying to do is we believe that politicians never do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not convincing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website takes 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we do a series of travel in the <unk> , where we take our audience to places of such cultural wonders , that you &apos;re going to take a lot of the stuff of anthropology , and hopefully , you will think of one after the other <unk> of anthropology , that this world has a really <unk> world , where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i &apos;m first to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we know as part of a <unk> over one year ago , and it &apos;s an <unk> environment , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either deal with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many <unk> of digital photographs here , which are <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in any sense .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at is how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one here is a scan of <unk> , and it &apos;s a scan of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing the performance of a system like this is , the number of pixels can be on their screen at any moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can actually do something like that , to really show that this is a real representation of <unk> and no picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with several dimensions .
we did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false display with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal ad , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even <unk> specs .
and this is really the kind of ideas that &apos;s really reaching for the available place on the screen .
and we hope that this is not going to be any <unk> and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , this is the mapping of one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we will be contributing to that area .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
<unk> on the <unk> picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s get something else out now .
this is even live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which connects to two different technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , who of noah <unk> , at a university of washington university , under steve <unk> at the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views that we can penetrate through pictures , and that experience of the <unk> resolution .
but the spatial structure of the images is actually meaning .
the <unk> have taken these pictures together to put them in the real space , where these footage that were made near the canadian <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , and you see elements of <unk> slides , and these things have been set up all space in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much <unk> .
i &apos;d like to show straight one of the <unk> data sets of noah to show , and this is from an early prototype of <unk> that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer , to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology that is <unk> , and this is not necessarily obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral notre dame , who had only done in the computer with pictures of flickr . just give them notre lady in <unk> t-shirts and on the <unk> and so on , each of this orange <unk> represents a picture that was discovered as a result .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> in perspective in this way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believe i &apos;m going to work at microsoft eventually .
and i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
well , i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is in the process of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a pretty large number of them all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
many of them are <unk> from faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs there -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the entire collective memory of what , visual earth looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these pictures are connected , and it creates something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the entire earth .
look at this as the sequel of what stephen <unk> was in virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s about the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s going to use its use for the user to use the user .
their own photos are going to be done with metadata <unk> that another person went on .
if somebody has done the effort and all these saints and tells you who they &apos;re all , then my photograph of the notre suddenly <unk> with all of this data , and i can use it as a starting place to go into this room , and use it as a starting place to use some of the <unk> social experience .
and of course , byproduct of all of that is the enormously rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that has been not only given by <unk> or satellite images and so on by collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand them right ? your software is that at a certain moment , within the next few years , all the images that are used in the world in common will be used to connect with each other ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if they want them to be <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting if you think about the abundance of <unk> information that many of these images have .
how if you do a <unk> for images , where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about it , which is a picture .
but how would it be , if the image is associated with all your pictures ?
it &apos;s the amount of <unk> and abundance that makes it really , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , this is really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book , which i hope to do with the other things you &apos;ve heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make yourself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed this .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies .
the official <unk> works like that , when our goal is to maximize the good of our citizens , this is all through the <unk> of the freedom .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , makes a sense of a human premise for human .
when people have freedom , each of us have the things for themselves to maximize the things that are maximizing our public and nobody has to decide .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more public you have .
this is , i think , deep in our water supply of water , that no one would come to mind .
and it &apos;s also deep in our life .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy in order to make a large number of <unk> in the unlikely case , that none of the 175 in the store is right for them .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> store for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , amplifier , and in that one electronics , there is so many <unk> facilities .
we can put together <unk> million different <unk> plants in the components that are being offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a boy that you could have every telephone you wanted to , as long as he came from ma .
you rented a phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
there was a consequence that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have an infinite choice now , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones in the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you can be sure they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it brings people to walk into business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone not too much .
in other aspects of life , which are very much more powerful than buy objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could do b or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b is the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , &quot; if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it the patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in the reality , a shift of the burden on the making of making decisions from somebody who knows something -- <unk> the doctor , and that &apos;s why not most likely it is to make a decision -- <unk> the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , that if you think about it at all , it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you &apos;re expecting to call the next morning to call and ask a change in the prescription .
so , something like our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent it .
and we tend to reinvent as much as we want .
that means that every day you wake up in the morning , they have to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everyone had one and they were able to <unk> as fast as they could , and then children got as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not when they did .
today , it &apos;s easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married ?
should i get married later ? should i only have children , or make it a career ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to do all the tasks that i don &apos;t have to do and not get good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl illustrates , with technology that allows us to work every minute of every single day of every single day on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about that the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look watching our kids as football , and we &apos;ve got our mobile phone to a hip and our blackberry to the other waist , and our laptop may be on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in which we <unk> our child at <unk> , we &apos;re also wondering , &quot; should i think that call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly your experience of the <unk> of your child , very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived in this .
i want to say that there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live in this now .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
an effect , a <unk> way , is that it <unk> <unk> .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to make it really difficult .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of this , a study of investing in volunteers in volunteers .
one colleague of mine had access to access to <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 <unk> who had a employers &apos; employer , who took a participation by two percent .
they provide 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees than if it would be five to five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> who are choosing to be choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you &apos;re supposed to choose to keep it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come .
do you understand that this is not just what people have to eat dog , if you go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the power , it means that you &apos;re missing the decisions that you &apos;re missing big <unk> of your employer .
through that , you can &apos;t give it up to 5,000 dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
they really want the decision to really meet , if it &apos;s all the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want the wrong investment to fund , or the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up less content with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is through the great range of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is it perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different decision , and what happens is that you could have a different decision , and what happens is that you have a choice to regret better .
the more possibilities there are , the more easy it is , it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> to regret that you meet .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert : a big point in this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things , depends on what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to remember , it &apos;s simply an attractive properties of alternatives that they leave in , that makes you less content with the alternatives that they &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he has missed the opportunity to have a great parking lot over day .
<unk> lower happiness down to our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more choices that we have , the more attractive properties of these choices are taking into account into this choice .
here &apos;s another example .
now this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a point about it in now , and maybe to do things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is that always who they decide to do , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to have what you &apos;re going to do less attractive .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this struck me when i was talking about my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was just jeans , and they bought them , and they have bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they carried them long enough , they started to go &quot; ok .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the <unk> , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the <unk> said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , easily <unk> or long ?
do you want the buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid ?
do they want jeans to holes ?
you want to cut down far , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw went down , and after i recovered , i would have like the way that the only way used to be . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all of those <unk> jeans , and i say the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt worse was , with all those options , my expectations for what a good <unk> is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations than they were in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , it would be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i had to have , and what i had was disappointing , and what i had was disappointing to what i was expected .
the add of opportunities in the lives of people inevitably increases the expectations of people who are going to be good about how well these possibilities are .
and this leads to less satisfaction , even though the results are good .
no one in the world knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what it is here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that used to be better than everything was worse than anything was worse than anything , it was possible for people to be able to experience a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we are wealthy , developed citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for you to ever hope is to be so good as you expect them to .
they &apos;re never comfortable because your expectations , my expectations are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve come to -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a quick moment -- that i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i wouldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of the <unk> of a <unk> sitting in sitting , if there &apos;s just a way to buy that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the world is safe . the world is responsible . what would you do ?
when hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy a <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people are making decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointing is because their standards are so high . and then , if you have to explain these experiences themselves .
and so this is the point that it &apos;s generally getting us better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official thing that we &apos;re all holding on is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that a little choice is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice than something choices .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point in a long time on the choice of our collective collective .
now , as an <unk> question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule , to ask the thing about thinking about that , and what all of these choices enabled in the industrialized societies , the material is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you , whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is they have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry : steve <unk> tells you yesterday about how these more expensive and hard to <unk> car seats , it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy you can &apos;t help .
it hurts .
you &apos;re worried that we are worse .
if something of what our society allows our society to make is make so choices to the societies in which people too little choice would be improved , not only improves the lives of human beings , but we would also be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> will make sure that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these great choices are <unk> .
finally , reading this cartoon , and a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what &apos;s this fish white ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
and the more i thought about it , the more i think that the fish is white .
because the truth is that if you break it down , that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break it down , so that everything is possible , you lower your happiness .
she increases paralysis and lower happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost limited to perfect security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we have digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by building new life and build .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists are trying to understand and at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different ways to simplify it up to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years , and when we sequenced the <unk> , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , whether we can regenerate lives , or could we make new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , who has the smallest genome of a species that can be able to replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with another smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes , from the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that &apos;s very simple to be very simple , compared to our . trust me , it &apos;s simple . but if we &apos;re all looking at these genes that we can eliminate one of the genes , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
and so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and make some of the fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does the chemistry allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules that have never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but our final point would now put on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years from a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so you make longer a piece , the more mistakes you do .
so we had to develop a new way that we could put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made little pieces , and we made a <unk> molecule , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and put into a bacterium , and the bacterium started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then <unk> from the cells , and they came back and killing e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they told you that they could understand this model .
they laughed more than you here .
so we think that this is actually a situation in the software actually building your hardware hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters code , and so we thought we &apos;re building it in cassette tapes , which is the size of the tapes , which is the size of the <unk> cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome first in 1995 , they had a <unk> <unk> pair of pairs of 10,000 pairs .
we found out the <unk> of 30 errors . if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and they need to overlap with other forms of computing to build smaller <unk> , so that they fit .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built into <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these characters are about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve created the pieces so we could just break them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that are fixing these enzymes and back together .
and we started making pieces , starting with <unk> of five to <unk> letters , put these together together to make these together to put these together to <unk> .
so in each step , we have these pieces in the surplus of the surplus to sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- then they &apos;re not just going to grow in e. molecular molecular biology , and so we used to get other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which is using the biology to repair dna that can come together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of three million rads of <unk> .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
you know , 12 to 24 hours later , everything that happens .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms are completely dried up , they can actually live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;re using only <unk> using the right design of the pieces , we put it out , yeast adds up , then it automatically put together .
this is not a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are footage over a period of six seconds .
this is the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about <unk> letters in <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we were to print it with a <unk> of 10 and without the distances of the sun , it would include just the genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we do it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus that &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s as easy as you do it in <unk> as we are , you just take the nucleus out and there &apos;s a different inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about cloning .
in <unk> , the chromosome is in the cell , and it &apos;s just recently shown that you can have a complete transplant a chromosome from one cell to others and can activate them .
we <unk> the chromosome of an <unk> , roughly , are these two apart from each other , like humans and mice , and we gave some <unk> so we could pick this chromosome , and it was very amazing to destroy all the proteins -- and it was very amazing to destroy the proteins -- and it &apos;s been very amazing .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get the process to a little bit .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we found all kinds of species here , a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every time thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene changed at a moment has missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are called <unk> , which actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was <unk> in the cell and realized the other chromosome as foreign material <unk> , and so we just had one cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of genes that we &apos;ve added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and <unk> completely into a new species of software that we gave in the cell .
all proteins changed out the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been driving .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , things change quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of cambrian explosion where there could be massive <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re about a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has been in 1946 in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . these are a hundred million drums a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from that material landing in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity that came out of this .
we &apos;re primarily hitting the limits of biological reality , and that &apos;s what we think about .
we now have technologies because of these fast fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
now , if you think about that 20 million of different genes or to make these processes to create <unk> or drugs , new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just selection of selection . we can <unk> from chemicals , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a shot of actual <unk> that we &apos;re working on , and they sit in the way that you &apos;re actually <unk> and <unk> new species on the computer design .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like . we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
so we &apos;re going to focus on the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn corn ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got fuels of the <unk> and third generation that will be pretty soon going to be a lot of <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way that biology has a huge impact on food or the limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as the material material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are working on the way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 into methane , using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could just be <unk> to <unk> , the co2 in the fuel to power this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> <unk> industry , right . if you &apos;re not going to do that at ted , where otherwise ? you know , you can get a <unk> of energy .
but the same thing we &apos;re doing now is to use the same approaches to vaccines development .
you &apos;ve seen it with flu this year , we &apos;re always a year in the back , and you have a dollar on the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by trying to create <unk> vaccines in <unk> .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be sped up today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we &apos;re improving light years from it , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive a long time to survive that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who are at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that have less than a <unk> second in the beginning of the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> cells in detectors .
this is what i work on . he &apos;s called a atlas of a detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 feet in diameter .
so this is a spectacular picture of the atlas in the design that you see by the scale .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine was for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it has huge <unk> in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that the entire way around the lhc is to do with a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture 10 of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if it was the largest <unk> , or this , when someone went to google side , went to the google page .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the science .
and about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that was doing with this wires -- these golden wires here here .
these wires are <unk> <unk> when the machine goes on <unk> .
now , the engineers among you will look at you and say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford it because if you cool them very far , they &apos;re called <unk> .
so at minus <unk> degrees , colder than the space between stars , can be able to withstand the tension of tension .
in one of the connections between the lhc , the lhc had a <unk> .
and so the wires and <unk> the wires and <unk> <unk> have suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is still amazing if you think the magnet just weigh 20 tons and it &apos;s been moving about 30 inches .
so it damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all over again .
by the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we expect to collect data in june , or july , and we continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way that such accidents have the value of science and <unk> on such borders , it &apos;s easy to reject it .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we reach beyond our borders , value the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to give my <unk> words in a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i guess , when he &apos;s <unk> the <unk> experiments , he was michael <unk> , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , to assume that our scientific ideas of the human mind is to assume that there are no new ideas .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
however , a recent thing in my life is happening in my life and my career that has brought me completely to this work completely .
this curious thing was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , unlike any of my previous books in the world , there was a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that , no matter where i come to be treated as if i was going to be treated .
seriously -- the doom <unk> !
for example , they &apos;re very concerned about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never <unk> that success ?
don &apos;t you fear that they create their entire life and never create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ?
okay , that &apos;s really power .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i first told them , when i was a teenager , i wanted to be in the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> don &apos;t you fear , never succeed ?
don &apos;t you fear the humiliation of a <unk> kill ?
do you don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re going to work on this craft , and you &apos;ve never come up with a <unk> , <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
like , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , <unk> , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i used that .
and i &apos;ve got a lot more things about a lot of things that no one would do .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i &apos;ve got to say , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that by somebody who should be expected to be afraid he was afraid to do the work that he was writing ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprise that they make us insecure about the relationship -- in a way it doesn &apos;t do other jobs ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can remember not a chemist in their 40 years to be chemists where he was asked to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you go with it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not given the reputation of <unk> <unk> people .
we seem to have a writer , but we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the <unk> , seem to be completely unstable .
all they need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds alone from the 20th century , who died young and often died .
and even those who were not actually <unk> , they seemed to be really neglected neglected from their talent .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books has killed me a little bit .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about their work .
but we don &apos;t even make a difference when we hear someone like this , because we know this kind of statements since so long , we have the notion of so breathing and collective accepted that creativity -- <unk> , of course , that art -- always leads to the <unk> .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is this idea of all right ?
now , do you feel about that ? because , with only one inch , i feel that i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion .
i find them really .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great training .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start , this dark path of a kind of <unk> -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m just in my career in my career .
that &apos;s -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world when the work is being judged by the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it <unk> , because we &apos;re all sort of friends now -- it &apos;s most likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that you can get someone to start to start 9 a.m. in the morning , gin and i don &apos;t want that .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
so after some of the <unk> , i seem to have to be able to write a kind of <unk> psychological construct .
so somehow , i have to find a way to write a safe distance from true between me and my very natural <unk> about how the response is going to be in the writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for this , and i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you had a better way of dealing with the emotional risks that are connected to creativity .
this quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the ancient greece and rome have not believed that creativity is coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown , unknown .
the greeks called these divine <unk> of creativity <unk> demons .
from socrates known to believe he had a <unk> , he was telling him a <unk> .
the roman idea had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit , a <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a very smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical <unk> creature that was believed that it was literally in the walls of a <unk> -- something like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist in a kind of <unk> <unk> and the result of the work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked so , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected in front of some things , like , for example , too high , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
when your work <unk> -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was something paralyzed .
so people really have thought of creativity in the west .
and then the renaissance , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put human individual to the center of the universe -- across all the gods and the mysteries , and there &apos;s no room to get more for mythical creatures .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity completely came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call people this one or an artist a genius -- instead of which he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a great mistake .
you know ? i think the naked person will allow him to think , or she &apos;s like the vessel of the tank and the essence , and the essence of all divine , creative , <unk> , infinite <unk> is a little too much responsibility to <unk> them .
it &apos;s like someone to swallow the sun .
the <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it generates all of these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> will have wiped out our artists in the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t make the <unk> for 500 years from 500 years to just get rid of it in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience , which are really <unk> scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically , <unk> , people who are <unk> and <unk> on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to put in , why not ?
why not thinking about this ?
because it makes a lot of sense like anything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it went to explain absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process which is -- like everybody knows it &apos;s ever tried to do something -- in other words , in other words , everyone here -- doesn &apos;t always be doing reasonable .
in fact , it can really feel like <unk> <unk> .
i had an encounter than i had a <unk> american poet <unk> stone , which is now about 90 , which was now 90 , but she told me that she was working on the fields , and she told me she was working on the fields , and she told me that she was going to be a poem about the landscape on the landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
that &apos;s where the land was going on to her .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that in a moment they could do just one moment , and that was -- in her words -- <unk> running like the devil .
she ran like the devil for her house while she &apos;s followed by this poem . it was the only thing you had to get fast enough to get a sheet of paper and a pencil to get it through her and capture on the sheet of paper .
they didn &apos;t get fast enough , and she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get her house and she missed her , and she told her , she &apos;d go through the country , and she told a other poet , looking for another poet .
and then there were those moments -- i &apos;ll never forget that i -- she said there were moments where they were almost missed it .
so she runs out to the house and looking after paper and the poem , she goes through her , and she picks up a pen , just when she <unk> and then -- she said -- it was like her to grab her other hand and get it out .
she caught the poem on his tail , and it went back into her body , and took it on the sheet of paper .
in those opportunities , the poem was <unk> and intact to the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first word .
and when i heard that , i thought , this is creepy -- this is exactly how my creative process is going on .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work every day , i have to get up at the same time and sweat , and <unk> me and really awkward <unk> .
but even in my <unk> , sometimes i have this thing <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done it too .
even i had work , or ideas that come from a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how do we get to lose our minds in relation to our minds , but to keep ourselves on the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this can be the musicians of tom <unk> , and i was allowed to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom <unk> the embodiment of the modern artist , trying to be these <unk> creative impulses that lived in him and deal with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that one day he went to los angeles , and there everything changed for him .
he was driving at high speed when he &apos;s suddenly hearing a little fragment of a melody , which , as it is , is a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s heavy , and he wants them . it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen ; it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts , that old <unk> in him , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and will be tracked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it .
but instead of <unk> , he just stopped .
he ended up all the time , and he did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , <unk> sorry , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m going to drive a car ?
i think <unk> is like i could just write a song ?
if you really exist , come back to a <unk> moment , come back to you .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else today .
go and leonard leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds it , it was open to the genius of itself , where he had nothing as trouble and then <unk> it where he was going to come from . he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could give you a <unk> , amazing , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and <unk> , physical thing , which wasn &apos;t a tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked , and it once saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell into one of these <unk> of the <unk> that we all fall when we &apos;re working on something , and it &apos;s not going to work . you start thinking about that it will be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just get this project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the sky , and i tried .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i was talking about my comment on a blank corner of the room .
and i talked loudly , you know , you know , you know , you and i both know , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m seeing everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up and follow your percentage .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to keep in writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you to the protocol that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like the following . centuries of centuries ago in the deserts of <unk> people , with holy dances and music , who stopped hours -- until dawn .
these strong were always great because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again and again , very rare , something happened . one of the actors was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen such a performance in your life .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancers were going through a kind of <unk> . he did nothing different than he has ever done before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything added together .
and all of a sudden , he never appeared in human .
it was lit from inside lit up , and it was lit up from the inside of the inside of a <unk> fire .
as something like this , people knew what that was . they called it on his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came out she brought this practice with , and the pronunciation changed over the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still hear about <unk> and <unk> .
if a performer has something impossible in spain , something magic has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> view of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancers wakes up even up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he no longer wears a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s merely a <unk> <unk> knee , and maybe it &apos;s going to be never going to rise to these heights .
and maybe again , anybody &apos;s going to name god &apos;s name , if he turns . but what do he want to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence came from them .
if you just believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source of your life that &apos;s passed on somebody else , when they &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think with security in the last few months , while i worked on the book , as i worked on the book , it &apos;s going to be soon as dangerous , frightening , to the expected successor to my own success .
what i have to say to myself is when i &apos;m crazy , i &apos;m not afraid .
not <unk> .
just do your job .
be still on your contribution to whatever it is .
when your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that you &apos;ve got to the side , decide , for a brief moment , you &apos;ll show a <unk> of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance , however , your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you despite all of this .
i believe in it , and i feel that we should teach .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you in all of this , just that you &apos;ve just got the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which , for nearly three million years , had the size of the lower 48 years to shrunk 40 percent .
but that doesn &apos;t press strong the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in the winter and <unk> in summer .
so the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> thing in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is with red .
as you can see , it grows on the <unk> , but this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> in summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
it will be gone from here in 25 years .
this is a problem because warming is the warming of the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of carbon dioxide in which there &apos;s huge amounts of carbon dioxide , which when it &apos;s done by microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , it could double the amount , if we cross that critical dot .
already in some shallow lakes today in some flat lakes , alaska is from the water itself .
professor <unk> walter university in alaska is with another group of a different <unk> lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be <unk> .
and one reason is , it &apos;s tremendous heat greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is far bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the level of sea level goes up , it &apos;s going to be <unk> in the ocean .
these rivers take a lot .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers signed the entire continent now has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed up by a few <unk> , it &apos;s especially very powerful in the melting .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see up the new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but when they &apos;re <unk> , also the most drinking water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra <unk> .
this affects the <unk> .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
so this <unk> in the world has a dramatic increase in fire .
and the catastrophes all over the world have increased in a really <unk> and unprecedented extent .
four times so many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve made 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific ocean , right , from the american continent and <unk> of india , where there is a radical decline in the ocean in the ocean .
the biggest factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the older biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more <unk> .
but we begin to see a change .
here are the ones that were eliminated in the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there is a political debate in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> did have spent a <unk> dollar last dollars to apply clean charcoal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
the christmas way around christmas , i went back to a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the commercials &apos;s commercials is this .
<unk> of <unk> is a <unk> , happy boy .
it gives him the shell and abundance of america , and it helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will be cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and they remain <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you one very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance of climate protection has two campaigns to live .
this is one , part of her .
we see climate change as a serious risk for our business .
and that &apos;s why we set up to the top <unk> , we spend a significant <unk> to spend a <unk> on the way to get the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells too well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave it to us .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning of one of the main reasons for global warming is the remarkable clean information that you see here , changes everything .
so look at it , this is today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security crisis , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all of these are linked together is our <unk> of <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free ourselves out of this kind .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , make us safer and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more things .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels that <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start with you to do it for the time of your childhood when they were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how to reach out the hands of reaching the hands , the <unk> , the <unk> , and moves , they learned to think about thinking and problems through understanding and change <unk> connection .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction of our interaction with real objects -- with my <unk> <unk> and my colleague , <unk> <unk> , i began to wonder : what if we could use computers , which moves , instead of a <unk> that moves like a digital <unk> system , which is , what if we could use computers , which is , you know , if we could use computers ?
and this question was so emotional that we decided to go and developed the answer to the answer .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and a <unk> screen .
more importantly , are physically physical , why you can only move them out of your hands and access to access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to manipulation digital data .
and when these tools are available , and they become a conscious awareness of their movements , and you can see each other and see the subtleties of our <unk> with them , then we can begin to start studying new and more entertaining .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> , and when i <unk> it in one direction , the video will play forwards , when i walk it into the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so when i put them next to each other , it makes your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded , you &apos;ll notice that and you can see something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and tendency .
there &apos;s an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like , like the color of the colors , how to do this with fluids .
in this case , we have three <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle , where they &apos;re getting together .
if we overdo it , we can get a little bit <unk> .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we &apos;re going to give people the possibility of fast and error and results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m creating with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
and basically , you get every round of each other up to each <unk> letters , and as you try to form words , this is about a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again , and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are a couple of kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try it and took a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people to test it .
this is our youngest <unk> at the bottom right there .
and it turned out he wanted to stack up just to stack .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a design model for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can get new characters in the scene by putting the <unk> from the table that shows this character .
this is the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the <unk> and you can put it on side to the characters , he can interact the characters .
... his own story .
hi .
it &apos;s a story of open , and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i have time for that today to show it is a <unk> for <unk> we &apos;ve been developing , and in the <unk> as a sounds like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can <unk> these notes into the sequence that you can organize in any patterns .
and you put them together by just having a <unk> of <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
and you connect it with a particular note and tends to get it .
and then there &apos;s a lot of effects like speed and volume that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we &apos;re starting to get the <unk> into two <unk> <unk> and this in a row , and then add a little bit more to the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something drums now .
and now i connect the filter with the drums so that i can drive the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by taking the speed into one or another .
and now i connect the filter to the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s going on .
and so i don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , but improvise ; it &apos;s going to prolong them in the way .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which are better to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the opportunities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
and the idea that i &apos;d like to give you on the way is that we are at the verge of this new generation of <unk> interaction with digital media to bring the information into our world , which are <unk> our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m happy to be there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i just have to step back just a little step , and it &apos;s busy with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking at this for a few years now , and that &apos;s what i started , because i just wanted to know , and i just wanted to know it , and it was also what i learned in the study of education .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i was going to get closer to the matter .
now , i think that molecular biology in general are generally spoken , all the way , all of what you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important now , and much more , much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like these all genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
there are craig venter now in the <unk> who &apos;s trying to make <unk> , so gasoline gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s some things that are totally aware of the everyday life , which most people don &apos;t realize , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash with 40 degrees , are genetically engineered enzymes .
and the list can continue and on there .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to move further on .
so what are now hacking ?
most people know that most people know this from the <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be hacking , and then in the media , it &apos;s always going to be like this , and the hackers break down somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of a sad thing for <unk> , because that &apos;s not what they actually hit what they actually did , and what &apos;s actually about it .
and in fact , the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a play , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a <unk> problem , so it can just be a <unk> , so you can get a question of <unk> , and how can you make it better .
and it &apos;s been done with software , but there &apos;s also in <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> system that &apos;s going to make all kinds of things that are doing .
and we &apos;re also looking at biology , and i want to see this metaphor that &apos;s coming out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a <unk> code , because , the <unk> code is a more abstract code , which is dynamic , which is dynamic , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program , and you can also hack it , and that &apos;s what i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get into a car much deeper .
actually , it &apos;s actually just <unk> eight of the shape , these these networks .
there &apos;s a <unk> dotcom , which is originally switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , which is now members and active people all over the world .
that &apos;s a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and also working with scientists in collaboration with these technologies to work with these technologies and ask these technologies , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always all about finding such a way to have a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s a <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more like this kind of forum where you &apos;re talking and talk online .
they &apos;re a little technical set and a little bit more <unk> on the way , and then they &apos;re going to be asked , <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that made the best popular , it &apos;s actually developed a scene that i &apos;d like to take a second .
here &apos;s a picture on the left on the left , which is a <unk> , so basically , a kind of school , a kind of private school , non-profit association , where everyone can be able to come .
children , old , all kinds of people go there to just go through that , and they set up a lab and look at what you can do , if you &apos;re doing these things .
there &apos;s a group on the left in indonesia here , which is <unk> , which is a pretty long time .
even longer than these other two networks .
and that also , in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , also <unk> , and combine it in quite a <unk> way .
in fact , a group of ankara that i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a <unk> that would just like to give up the public more , what they &apos;re learning about in college , and they &apos;ve tried to try to explain what <unk> is .
and i &apos;ve got a lecture up in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen with an exhibition in copenhagen .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s most of the most of young people , but the only thing that what it actually is , is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with it , and they &apos;re also very focused on the society with <unk> and ask , okay , what do you want to join , you have an interest in trying to bring you to that ?
so , <unk> , to hack biology now , you need some material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
in fact , what you usually understand under a lab , they &apos;re kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , only for <unk> , trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say to say , <unk> , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every one of each <unk> has actually developed technology than most of them , it &apos;s really like this .
and it &apos;s my premise right with that premise to that premise , for example , brian <unk> , for example , was trying to have a <unk> <unk> , and then took a <unk> <unk> , and it was a <unk> , and then it &apos;s bred bacteria .
so each one , which has been a soup of a soup that he has left too long before .
i then tried to take it back in my lab , a little bit of scale , and then take a little bit of <unk> on ebay and a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to get a <unk> , so that &apos;s like a <unk> , so on .
now that &apos;s not really a joke now , but this is what it should be .
here you see in the picture at the bottom is the lab , in <unk> , so this is such a <unk> garage with all the things that the university of <unk> has a group in paris , which is in place , a group in paris , which is in place , which i want to do with a very interesting thing , which is what i want to do .
and this is <unk> , which just mentioned <unk> , this one , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , a kind of <unk> in molecular biology .
and yeah , so you can see it &apos;s relatively relatively relative , so that &apos;s where you have people who are doing it at home , so far to large organizations , to even have more <unk> , even in <unk> form .
but just the way that the approach is that it &apos;s supposed to be easy and accessible .
the first project we did as an international group as we were aware of our own ourselves , <unk> , we have this kind of scene now , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re now familiar with the people that always goes on .
and then came from the <unk> &apos;s website at the founder of the founder , and he said <unk> , we &apos;ve got to actually meet real , too , and then have two events organized , one in london , <unk> 10 , and shortly on it , in san francisco .
and then , there it was , too , <unk> , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our goals , our basis ?
and then we have a <unk> out of this .
this was quite intuitive , so everybody just got his wishes , his and what it goes , put it , put it .
and i think , i think , a really good code .
and then we have that , you know , that &apos;s not that , but that &apos;s still , i think it &apos;s pretty good at it , and people are quite good at this .
and we actually tried to do that in the academic world , but there &apos;s no way to get there .
so , i think we &apos;re in the <unk> , even further than the academic world .
yeah , what do we do for projects now ?
a project i did with the <unk> in switzerland itself was that we wanted to make an optical event or optical event .
this is , if you focus a laser beam in space , you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then you move in that focus , so it &apos;s going to be trapped there , so , like this , you have a <unk> like this .
it really works that it &apos;s done in the academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , we may get a webcam , <unk> the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , <unk> , you have a microscope .
you see that down there .
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> the laser , and then try to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , that didn &apos;t work out , but we still learned a lot .
this is another project that made from the french group there , and that &apos;s really , really cool .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s like , you know , this is a kind of <unk> , like this , or something like this , so he &apos;s engaged with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this helmet this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors in the room could go in the room , put it on this chair .
and then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought they &apos;re then different lights in the space .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which has to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes to reproduce , <unk> , to multiply fragments so that you can see them visible .
so , if i do this , you know , the <unk> of the crime scene , then they go , collect any <unk> , and then they do this method , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair &apos;s hair belongs to this person .
and the machines that make things like this , they &apos;re quite expensive that you buy commercial , the least going to take the cheapest , the cheapest .
and it &apos;s not in <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of a lot that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got so two two builders and i said , <unk> , we make it easier and cheaper , and then they get out of open source , so that &apos;s open source , energy available , that this device is <unk> , and now they are now that the cheapest supply of these devices .
i think kind of like six dollars or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project i started recently was building a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> , it &apos;s about so far , two centimeters or something .
you use <unk> <unk> , and they put them into these <unk> , and then i &apos;ll get it on <unk> and then put it on <unk> and then put it like this .
so the device you see there , it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is so my prototype , which is , but it &apos;s pretty wild looked like this , so a branch on it , put it on , put electronics on it , and that was the pressure of <unk> , and it was the pressure .
and then i took a <unk> and put this on this .
a <unk> , if you make the full power of water , have enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s like 40 to <unk> bar .
and then you can then speed up the particles strong enough , and then you can go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about 300 euros , or something like this to 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially feasible .
so , that &apos;s the moment that we &apos;re doing also , too , the <unk> of the scene , to increase this availability of technology , and also increase the information and <unk> that more people can be engaged in there .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a pretty little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really well .
because when you read about it , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve seen it yourself or saw it yourself .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make some meaningful decisions in society , you want to be able to get meaningful decisions and join , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand .
and then , under the <unk> open <unk> and citizen science .
so , as citizens will be <unk> , it &apos;s a kind of scientific technology through it .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who actually put at least officially on the website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s also in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s because there are fewer people in fact than actually exist .
so i know about some who haven &apos;t put themselves .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
in part , with these <unk> , they put these places together .
and that &apos;s the very beginning .
as i said , <unk> has only started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first one , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> that have become all over the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re also going to take a lot more and bigger , and then very well connected , so you can also stop being involved in it .
and i would invite every one of them to deal with it and even try what .
now , it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and <unk> enough energy , you get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we work humans ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very concerned about as a designer , but also in the field of <unk> , and also <unk> all the things in the area .
it &apos;s about how to do people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make it an equal experience .
because i think that interactive media in us have cognitive models , cognitive models , which , in our biological memory , has been in a very , very long time in our biological memory , and that we can only create by interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these <unk> , which you &apos;ve encountered , that you &apos;re going to get into the future , but actually it &apos;s so that the future is right to us , in our <unk> roots .
now , what are <unk> models now ?
i just wrote down four <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain to you briefly .
and that &apos;s the models of cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models we have in the pre-industrial moment .
now , to this <unk> models , we heard that we &apos;re basically a natural relationship to virtuality .
and that sounds basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to go into it again , and i &apos;m going to prove to you by trying to prove a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to speak very , very , very , very <unk> , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media by definition are <unk> , which is the denial of linearity , and what makes us , of course , we say the linearity today is normal .
the fourth point is that the story of us is a place of <unk> .
now , what about the virtuality that is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors did the house that you live in ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to don &apos;t immediately answer you immediately , but it will happen to what &apos;s happening in the moment .
they go in the spirit through this house , in <unk> you live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it <unk> the reality , without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to deal with the virtual reality for example , to show the virtual reality in our <unk> , so we can do that all the time .
and this wealth that the virtual reality is to <unk> the reality of the reality , which people have so needed in the pre-industrial times as well , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this mind , the memory is going off .
in this mind , <unk> and with these virtual images , the imagination , we have been passed to know also .
and therefore , it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality as well .
the interesting thing is , if i can do a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that at the time of the human at the same time , it was <unk> and medium itself .
if you &apos;re going to think a bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk about that again .
so the primary tool that &apos;s been <unk> has been over has been stories .
<unk> , priests , <unk> <unk> , were extra <unk> to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong today .
the author of the book called the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we &apos;re still <unk> over every year with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a child that &apos;s been spent most of the time of his life , most of the time of his life .
now we think our love to stories depends on that we sat in the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
that &apos;s a lot further back , in the pre-industrial cultures .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , what interactive media is so impressive is that we have <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think about it .
i brought you an example with the north american tribe of <unk> .
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you just had to navigate from island to island island to get into food .
and they made this so-called <unk> <unk> .
you may also know that if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian age of australian american .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have <unk> , but they used to use the <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what the interesting thing about it is that the <unk> and the topography of regions of songs could be mapped .
where the language was rang by <unk> .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and this sound , the geology , which represented the topography of the region , and that has also enabled you to <unk> these songs , and put them together , and to go to the left , to the right , and again to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing from the top from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
that &apos;s what happens is that the <unk> machine age .
we &apos;ve got the so-called <unk> movement in the world .
what happened is the machine age , and it &apos;s happening is the book , and it &apos;s happened to happen .
and this is exactly what happens that we have the responsibility for our memories and the <unk> of our individual memories , in external media .
on the book and the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to <unk> a piece .
virtuality is suddenly alien to be <unk> for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> at <unk> , saying that this mass media , he says the book and the image , so not the television , the internet , and so on , what we call mass media today , and our ability to have <unk> <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from <unk> to the machine age .
what does influence on our thinking and on our <unk> ?
and then the <unk> means of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more <unk> over the centuries and more <unk> by the influences of the <unk> .
that is , instead of being individually able to remember , we have standardized , common , common pattern of memories that are able to hang out our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in pictures that are not in images , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve got used to things that things happen .
and we have the linearity as law , and there are only exceptions , like , for example , <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
we still have been arrested as a <unk> very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , and we had the age machine , and we &apos;re now going to call this called <unk> .
and that sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very , <unk> , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> , which will bring us back to our skills back to our skills .
this is about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to just explain this for a long time .
there are technical concepts like this augmented reality , which means the augmented reality .
so , if you look at google <unk> , for example , then you &apos;re looking at this concept , which is a concept of what the virtual world can combine the virtual world to the real world , which is the virtual state of being normal , which is going to be in the virtual place to feel natural .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , this is what &apos;s going crazy , of course , in the context of my talk , that we &apos;re going to move forward to <unk> , virtual worlds , which is the model of <unk> .
and other example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all of that needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real real habitat .
and i graduated from the way , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and they &apos;re also here today .
you might just get up for a minute , so that you can pause for the two about the project .
and this project , i brought with me as an example of how again , that &apos;s going to addresses cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
and of course , what the <unk> of , of course , is a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;re very likely to have some of people who have people who have some <unk> <unk> , or they &apos;re playing with some of some <unk> in your hand .
anyway , in any case they &apos;re doing it .
this is a game for the outside .
and that &apos;s in focus , so i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize that i need to be so <unk> so much .
and you can actually explain a lot better , there &apos;s a lot more behind it .
and this is the point that i discover a city of what i &apos;m looking at in terms of a positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get to get a very different view of the city , which is a very different impression , and i see negative zones of the city and the positive zones of the city and a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to sum this up , my talk , in the sense , that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from <unk> <unk> , and that went to a little bit of <unk> at the age of the world , which is that what &apos;s called <unk> <unk> , and that we have a little bit of <unk> at the age of the future , it &apos;s actually going back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked if this bag is a <unk> bag and i &apos;m going to talk to my instead .
that &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to disintegrate also , which is in there .
but i &apos;m just just curious about it .
yes , children are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creator of the house , so , of course , i &apos;m involved in the subject of curiosity , and how the curiosity also change our thinking , and why are we going to lose curiosity and so forth and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re looking at in your sense as a creator .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to <unk> in the n .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half a year .
it &apos;s a <unk> to a natural user interface of design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the things that are coming up with such natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so forth .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices up , because things are being more intuitive , more and more natural , more natural , <unk> , and you have to wait , what &apos;s actually for us people , of course , what is <unk> or intuitively .
and in front of the background , i put myself in the area of natural user interface , so the next generation of human computers in the relationship with the human relationship with the human relationship with the computer of computers , or how the computer has changed from the computer .
so i &apos;m busy dealing with what is , of course or intuitively .
maybe again , a look at it again .
why does that happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , in fact , in short , we &apos;re moving from the third to fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> through language .
this is , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked a common language , you could communicate with each other is to put in the same cave , and in other areas , cities educated or villages , and they &apos;re sort of creating <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very living .
well , you had to learn to learn , so no toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it <unk> , and of course .
that then became the <unk> society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> <unk> , because , of course , the living language , of course , began to be <unk> in form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive , i &apos;ll start it in stone , and i &apos;m also <unk> it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s of course a completely different coverage than if there &apos;s an alive kind of alive .
but then , in fact , the script was then made as a <unk> , got moved .
and then the next generation , where we actually actually live in primarily .
this is just by pressure and <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was the same thing that the <unk> , the <unk> and others said , are you really insane , when the people starts to read , and then they want to join them , and that &apos;s of course totally <unk> .
and now we come to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , it &apos;s just a <unk> story for every few hundred years , and we actually are at the moment in this sort of <unk> phase that we &apos;re going to join this .
and of course , the confused of us , of course , because we see the new media , the social media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what about the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the <unk> and no beef , is more or other phenomena , which i just want to just <unk> , and i want to <unk> it .
and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this new society , these new society , these <unk> , are very many mechanisms and principles and the <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
now , it &apos;s not at the local level , but on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
the theme of ecology is a global global .
not if i think a local <unk> and your neighbor thinks less green , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village , it &apos;s actually become a global village with the same principles , as well , of course , to the same principles , the most possible , but also total transparency .
as you were in the village at the time , who knew what and when , this is what happens to me today , through this expansion of our self through the <unk> level of a global level .
be that we know globally , and it &apos;s faster and more and better , <unk> .
like it used to happen before the village before .
in front of the background , i just got to look at what &apos;s called , which is , in fact , what we have , of course , what we might have , of course , what we might have , but instinctively , what makes the difference ?
because they &apos;re often coming , they can &apos;t make it <unk> , so everyone can handle it .
so you have to deal with it , which means that , and not just just change it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and when it is , of course , something is intuitive , and how can i be a creator of influence , and so you can make things like this , so that you &apos;re so intuitive , so you can be intuitive , because they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re easy to use .
you &apos;re engaged in it as well as the student , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and this is , of course , what you &apos;re starting to start and watch and say , okay , i &apos;ll just watch it in the inside .
and what does it look like in it ?
so how do we work , if we <unk> ?
and what does , of course , means , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of perception and how does it work the cognitive processing ?
because steve jobs have said you to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something out or intuitively <unk> , which means that at the core .
and you can see that you have a seven senses , most of the things we think are only five , it &apos;s actually seven , it &apos;s actually seven <unk> , and i &apos;m certainly going to add the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of ourselves .
and to see how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of them use the word , but don &apos;t know what it then means en .
but i have to understand at the core , to understand when it gets information to information , when you get data out of data and from information , so i know that i know things as well as i can do things as well as things .
and of course , how does design influence on perception .
so we see this , when i make things , i can shape them confusing , like on the right-hand side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or <unk> , or i can make it sort of intuitive to show things .
so much more natural , in a vessel , but i look directly at the way where it is salt and pepper .
and if i say to someone , give me salt or pepper , and then you &apos;re going to think about it , where it &apos;s in .
and so on the left intuitively , and then i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in there , the salt in the way that you have no sugar .
but also our perception of ourselves , how does it matter us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right part of the right is bigger than the small one , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just about the same size , and yet our perceptions , depending on what context we &apos;re doing .
anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should still work .
there &apos;s more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle begins to relate to some resemblance or associate .
and if i take a <unk> <unk> , then we don &apos;t just see one of a unit , which is a circle , circle and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle .
it &apos;s called <unk> or <unk> , which is also influenced by perception .
it &apos;s important for the designers who have the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> of the continuity , and so on .
so often , in third , forgotten .
but this is an essential important part , if you want to make things so much more intuitive .
so the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting to vision .
it &apos;s very banal first , but it &apos;s interesting to be really exciting when you &apos;re busy doing it .
so we &apos;ve got the eyes now , and now you think we &apos;re seeing from the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see from the back to the front .
and it &apos;s an assumption , which is that you see something that you recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we &apos;re only going to see what we see before we see it in the back of our <unk> <unk> , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got a cognitive <unk> , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s also there , that &apos;s coming back again .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t stop the front and say , well , you know , i &apos;m going to look for you , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re looking at what you see .
and then it goes back again , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , a whole , very <unk> process of how certain things are going and what these things happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know of this picture .
there &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve just described .
now everyone is trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
anybody see a particular one ?
<unk> , right .
if i saw this , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a <unk> inside , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , you always see him .
that means , i &apos;ve actually <unk> her now that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i have them <unk> them within a very short time to see this dog in this <unk> picture .
and this is this projection of vision , <unk> , vision .
now , i know it , and now i &apos;m moving forward to the front of the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , quite exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gray is what you &apos;re not actually doing , but just here in this <unk> crowd .
does anybody know what three seconds ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something about three seconds , until i sort of <unk> out of the present , i can also bridge out of the present , and i &apos;m also able to bridge that by having someone in three seconds .
it only has to process that as a present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge a very elegantly <unk> for example on the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what &apos;s <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you fall in love .
that means if you know that , you know who you &apos;re looking at , you know who you &apos;re looking at like long , because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen to that .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions that we have .
that means that this first impression happens at a very rapid speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at is what we &apos;re looking at , and how we sort of <unk> ourselves against our environment , so we can think about this .
but , of course , the <unk> are not only concerned with the subject of perceptions , and neural <unk> or <unk> , but by of course , with the subject of <unk> .
so how a human being goes around with certain things .
so , there &apos;s some kind of things that are practical , so there &apos;s so specific things or <unk> things .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly where i actually have to reach .
but there &apos;s the symbolic functions , why there &apos;s somebody for such a little <unk> , where they don &apos;t have anything to do anyway , so money money money from money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on the <unk> , on the <unk> that we think of , of course , in terms of , of course .
back to my actual subject of natural interface and the theme , which of course is <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> means , as i can quickly reach a certain destination , or how a user has to reach a certain way to be able to achieve efficient , efficient and <unk> .
that &apos;s what it says is the norm .
how can i make something more possible ?
i can do that directly , or i need to have an n or i need to do an <unk> training for that .
and less <unk> or <unk> .
i &apos;m just making it a different process of doing beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand that .
and if you were in part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , and you can also understand why <unk> percent of our current software today is very intuitive or not based on <unk> , which is also more intuitive in many areas or <unk> software , even though it &apos;s more intuitive than classical software .
now , an intuitive <unk> is not only for apple to be a sense of <unk> , <unk> sense of <unk> , if i just want to harness technological devices .
why ?
because in the rule , we have this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user <unk> , for example , are five times faster than average on our target .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classical <unk> , you have to do five hours , and it &apos;s just an hour with this new kind of natural software .
that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re going to be able to go home four hours more , but your employer or anybody will fall out of it , as he &apos;s busy doing it for four hours .
but i want to say , of course , there &apos;s a brain <unk> for us to do some things .
so when we put ourselves into the field of the software , here &apos;s the first <unk> <unk> interfaces that were very abstract , where it took months to cope with these systems .
and then the next thing that now came up with the <unk> neural model or mental model like the software <unk> , which is , you know , you have an idea of something , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so not more zeros and ones or ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
that made it a lot of <unk> , but it also goes much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is working a lot more with behavior .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing is a lot of a lot more more often than this .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that , in fact , that it &apos;s always possible for the success , that &apos;s going to be a app .
and then , if i take one step into this natural interfaces , interfaces , where i have a voice by language , by language , by <unk> , by the gesture , and not more by mouse and <unk> things , i &apos;m still faster , and one hand .
but that leads me to the point again , when will things be intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here and see , what does this mean from looking at the <unk> , when is now something really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s a very intuitive for us to humans , if i have to think so little about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to be thinking , but we don &apos;t want to be able to do that .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means , if we look at existing technologies that we can put on something else in something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that as a creator .
that means i can take an intuitive to a human being on a software , and put the software a lot of <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what is actually the most powerful thing that we do , and now i &apos;ve been telling it .
this is what we call <unk> .
this is all using us and <unk> is an acronym and it &apos;s for you , <unk> , inform , <unk> .
that &apos;s all of you all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s partly intuitive , or partly instinctively .
the model is already <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , without most people knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> times as much of us as the activity , which is sleep in the sleep , and then it turns out it &apos;s less frequently than a day .
now , i can now be able to pick up this mental <unk> , you know , inform , <unk> , <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , which is similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but now it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> as the transmission metaphor of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i look at this now , for example , in which i orient to the <unk> , you know , as a choice , inform me , it &apos;s big to me , i can look at it in the detail , and you can buy it in the details , and you can buy it somewhere , or shop , and so on .
then i can transfer it all .
i &apos;m trying to go through a <unk> .
so , everybody &apos;s eating cake already .
that &apos;s now that i interact with the object , it can be <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get all the overview of this , and i can say this , and i can say , just show me all the thing with chocolate .
and once you have an interface , which is more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach the things like that bits , it can be <unk> , and it &apos;s going to come to me , is much more natural than if we have organized <unk> websites or other mechanisms to sort of make these things accessible .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with that phrase , i &apos;d like to take too close to the evidence , a and another hint , too , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you get a child as a child , is that you care about what <unk> you have , right ? and depending on whether their parents have allowed them to play more or less in the <unk> , and the kind of curiosity , of course , will turn into this .
and the curiosity can &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why all of these are and curious , in fact , people have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;ve been doing it now , basically , this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years to do in quality .
and there &apos;s a central dot .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
and every day , they &apos;re going to give <unk> to about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to record two grams .
you can &apos;t have teeth otherwise .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be able to be <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t actually take phosphorus and give it .
now , amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re talking about here with something that &apos;s actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not like that .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
it &apos;s much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve been phosphorus only for two years , and now we &apos;ve got a lot more uranium in the world in the world , and put much uranium into the environment as in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years alone , <unk> tons of uranium tons of our fields had been distributed in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i would say , <unk> your child , just blow it three times rather than five .
that &apos;s just a bit less destruction .
if we think about this from <unk> to <unk> , our entire earth will be used to or later a <unk> .
so this is about thinking about <unk> to the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
in the floor , over 60 percent of the <unk> .
right now , we &apos;re going to build corn and 30 pounds of 30 tons per hectare , or on the square meter of <unk> .
that means we lose about five five thousand times more than new .
so , of course , we can look at the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or content .
in <unk> , for example , there are 20 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and because we get older , the <unk> <unk> will be bigger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby takes about six thousand .
we could , of course , to reduce 10 percent , but what does it do ?
it &apos;s balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to this <unk> ?
here is one of the proof that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted by the pigs on the <unk> .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what happened to that , right ?
so , traditionally , we think in <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you think of the people that if you have the people who get it out there , if you say that would be better , you &apos;re not there , then they will be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing to be known as the human population .
in israel , you say , when you get a human life , you get the earth .
here it says , the more you go , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then they weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites in the united states , but in the united states , nobody would termites in so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they work a lot harder than we work , and because they live only three to six months , they are in your weight , something more 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we were going to do , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , and how sad we are , we can see that , for example , there &apos;s a program , to 20 40 , you want to be here <unk> , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be a tree , right ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
fortunately , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> of trees .
there are still six billion trees alone in the <unk> .
you &apos;ve already heard something about <unk> trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than the trees .
and where you see , even as demeter , the <unk> <unk> , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> back .
every year we &apos;re losing three million tons of tons that really would have to go back into loops .
and so we &apos;re too many .
on it alone .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they &apos;re saying that our own <unk> will go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s also about having a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s not going to be there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> when they &apos;re not there .
even if you were shooting at that , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do this in brazil in where we get the nutrients back .
right now , we can <unk> nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re going to do this in china , for example , where we &apos;re directly taking the waste .
in china , one of the things that i mean is a <unk> today , sort of , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
this is called the whole western <unk> that the city has always taken , but it never has returned to the farmers .
so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers were going into cities , and the cities would still have to move away their nutrients .
so all the western empires are expanding , until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to have <unk> civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to keep the nutrients out .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to the food in china , you would expect to go after the food that they &apos;re going to go to the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients out .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat them , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet how to get the nutrients back .
this is actually beautiful , if you &apos;re doing this , which is agriculture , which makes biogas , on a hectare of five , five thousand people in favelas , with a farmer for five of five people , you can get a farmer for <unk> dollars on favelas , and the facility and vegetables and vegetables and <unk> and <unk> .
and the great thing about this is that the average rate in the favelas is back in the favelas by all over <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people so bad .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s of course <unk> , but the facilities carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed so through design that a farmer can just manage it .
that means that the <unk> go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve done now over <unk> , in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have been ever done .
they could just <unk> a liter of <unk> <unk> , and then it would be ruined over years .
there &apos;s not instead .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people to be so bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we have to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what they want to do , they &apos;re at the best <unk> of the treatment of wastewater treatment , which is in <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can actually help the <unk> .
because the <unk> plant could best get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s going to work .
we &apos;ve been deployed over three years now in holland .
the dutch government explains , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need this overall .
you understand , there are two countries that control <unk> is almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s world .
there &apos;s a bunch of <unk> to opec .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the control system .
and that oil is going to replace us by others .
but the phosphorus will not replace .
that &apos;s not about making the existing things a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s efficiency , not about efficiency .
of course in holland , it &apos;s easier , of course , because in holland that the country &apos;s built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you &apos;ve got them <unk> , and she comes to fifty roses .
very inefficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eats about six <unk> three pounds in your lifetime .
here .
it &apos;s not very , scientifically right , because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going on .
but a <unk> , even at this light , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn the <unk> , a little bit better and <unk> it , and to lose all the materials in the loops , but first to ask , how do you make loops ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i had dinner for the dinner and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , <unk> ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not about saving , to reduce .
all the <unk> .
we say to the people , you know , you don &apos;t have a green story .
no , that will just be the right thing , yes ?
in every place where you &apos;re <unk> , yes , you get <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
we &apos;re thinking north .
there is every footprint there .
if they walk , yes , everybody footprint on the ground .
because the ground is going to die the mosses , and the wind and the water is washing away the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , any footprint means that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a huge footprint which is a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just <unk> .
so don &apos;t save , prevent , avoiding .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you can see in italy , like the people in the high bow can &apos;t kick out of the car .
because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> machine , which is an <unk> liquid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they go everywhere .
and it contains seeds from rare plants , so that they &apos;re going to contribute to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not all should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using it , they don &apos;t use them .
only the things that are <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who need to be in biological systems .
the things that are being used , go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re only talking about biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
all right ads , and not for the company <unk> <unk> <unk> , but that they &apos;re helping this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do the things that we do not free .
yes ?
so , when i say it <unk> to eat and say , it &apos;s free of <unk> , then it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of biological loops , right ?
all of it is <unk> of it .
and if we can do that , of course , we can do , of course , for nike , for nike and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and that &apos;s half of the world &apos;s population , which is caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re helping people ask for people .
hey , <unk> , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve already changed twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not as sure if you &apos;re really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
this is what &apos;s been shown .
that goes .
we can do things like that , if you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can produce biological loops .
there &apos;s also the same .
there &apos;s a direct thing for this .
this is the first green <unk> , actually , who &apos;s done to go back into the cycle .
so that , in any store , you can <unk> things .
if you come on , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
if at the moment it &apos;s garbage .
all the <unk> <unk> are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there on the front of the <unk> , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go to biological systems , if we change the climate change , inside that they can go back to <unk> , then they can go back to a baby in israel or in tunisia , trees .
yes ?
when they take these <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re the <unk> and the powder to plant the trees .
that &apos;s the baby <unk> for the entire life , already from beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i created an institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working on , and you can all get engaged .
it &apos;s an extra club , <unk> , where everyone can join .
so , not saving anymore , prevent , avoiding , reduce , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does you do that ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that as a <unk> , i was a <unk> , which is in english , so i understand .
<unk> are the translator &apos;s <unk> grades in <unk> music .
that as a translator , it &apos;s not just word for the word of the text in a different language , but also to understand the deeper sense of words and <unk> , so that it makes a meaningful translation of it , everybody knows it to do with <unk> .
to translate into english in the german german , you can have more knowledge , because if you &apos;re about poetry or poetry , or even about poetry .
it &apos;s become alien to what we do with our <unk> musicians .
and as a <unk> one , i just got the written notes .
you certainly think that a composer in the notes has all the <unk> that he imagined .
in fact , the grades are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are roughly the same or <unk> , like a verbal verbal , as a very seemingly <unk> description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the degree of <unk> , just to <unk> , not to hear the <unk> of the <unk> .
that means , the role of the interpreter has to figure out these <unk> data on another one , which is <unk> , potentially <unk> , non-verbal <unk> .
today , i want to share with you what else i can translate , so <unk> , even in a verbal language .
so this is a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do this in german , because if i had to translate it even to english , it would be for me equivalent to the equivalent of the translation of translation .
so that , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> grades have the function of a typeface .
so it &apos;s not going to be going to get to learn grades and to press the keys on the piano or the right place on the piano .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
and the point of the letters is one when you can do the language .
and so , you need to have to have to do at least as long as the spoken process of music as well as the spoken language .
so , there &apos;s also <unk> , if you &apos;re learning it for the <unk> , it &apos;s only passive , or you can also talk active , until the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts like a <unk> .
after you first have chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to <unk> all of the things that we &apos;ve been excited about .
you collect information over the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers .
you &apos;ve been studying the works that he did before and after .
you put comparisons .
the <unk> to write it .
how did he feel ?
how was his circumstances , what about society and politics ?
all of this interests me .
you think in that time , by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
but with the time , you &apos;ve also got a rich knowledge of the composers , the composers that you play more often , and it &apos;s getting easier to feel in it and feel it .
but the composer is always getting more to the friend that you live together .
his cause to write the play is becoming more and more and more to my personal cause .
now , now the grades of all of this is an accurate record of the cause of composers , but only a framework , now i &apos;m now able to turn this framework to make it back and meaning back .
i &apos;m going to say to my own words , which might be written between this framework .
i &apos;m playing <unk> , which could have these notes .
now for me , and for the composers of that , and what you might mean for him today .
each note , every phrase gets a sense because i feel it yourself because it comes out of my personal <unk> .
it has to be <unk> for me and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience to make sure that my cause .
and again , it &apos;s a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i have worked so long in the way that i have worked .
you know , like you &apos;ve seen a happy new day , even though always with the same rituals of life , stand up , breakfast , your breakfast , the work , i &apos;ll always get the same thing over to new .
i &apos;ve become a day older in a day that &apos;s going to change seasons , my pulse goes down at night than the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer to come back than home .
i &apos;m going to take the audience breathing , conscious or unconscious .
all of this affects me , and all of this affects my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s a wonderful thing as well as i stand on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and then you &apos;ll get this answer with a reaction .
so it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have to do , and what you &apos;re not able to do is not samples .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and they have seen the audience when the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this .
i can &apos;t play today in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> , emotions and emotion as today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> also , but i &apos;m going to have a new <unk> .
have a nice concrete example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> on my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a known <unk> , <unk> and long professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was much too young so that he was already <unk> , when i finally started studying .
but i was the great fortune to meet him in the age of 13 , and so i was in my school in my high classes .
i was 17 at the time when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last of the <unk> <unk> by chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me , what is the introduction of that <unk> for me .
this is such a part of the world .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he <unk> and said , so ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was already over <unk> .
well , with 17 , you have dreams still dreams , but it &apos;s not a significant memories .
i play it all over every few years now , and it &apos;s always changed for me , even though it doesn &apos;t changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i &apos;ll read something new .
one example of it , like , is a very different area . prints , the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , <unk> light .
it &apos;s got the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as he looked at it in that moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the most powerful interpretation of a piece is comparable .
by now , i &apos;ve been older as the chopin with <unk> years when he wrote the piece .
he only lived for <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look back in the grades again , even when i mean to memorize them .
in order to keep <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now how do you start talking to the language of music ?
and i said yes , you need to do about just as long as the spoken language .
often , the <unk> is so that you just learn the notes .
you &apos;re actually learning to be able to read it before you just speak one word .
you learn to find the notes on the screen on the instrument .
so when all the fingers in time and in time , and it &apos;s kind of like it &apos;s going on the notes , then the sound that sounds like that sound like music .
if that happens , the students get the <unk> piece .
on interpretation , hardly spoken .
all right , there &apos;s the front of it , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s most here .
but even though you put that data , it still leaves some technical .
and yet it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that a lot of a sudden is to forget .
and that , to make music on the instrument , to do your own musical and feel about it before .
that &apos;s what singing .
a child who didn &apos;t have learned that singing , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it by themselves .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music , and then it &apos;s a more opportunity to get over an instrument , to make sound .
people who have never been singing , have never felt immediately with the body , as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
namely the instrument that is the expansion of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to the dancing .
so the <unk> in the piano are the sequel of my finger .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
it &apos;s not <unk> today with music today .
you don &apos;t need to make more music if it gets bored .
no longer needed whistling or singing .
each of your own music will be <unk> , if you &apos;re constantly <unk> from the outside of music .
sure , there are some of them who say yes , but what do you do if if i don &apos;t sing ?
i ask that i don &apos;t sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both , it &apos;s not too late to see if they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles that hire the vocal chords , it &apos;s actually used .
we can train this .
or c , because you have <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> .
that &apos;s what i ask , like <unk> competent , was this diagnosis ?
did you have a <unk> or <unk> , how do you say it today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want music to do with it too .
but then , what i would do , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also do it again .
well , you see , all cases , nobody has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i said , but i &apos;m sure you can tell if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s somebody saying , i don &apos;t know if i can do it because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen consciously , and tell them whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is too sweet or too sweet .
tell what they feel .
the time you also get standards , and you want to do something more spices there , or taste even fine differences .
so why am i asking for my audience that you can also listen to action ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of work that you never look at is not being a force .
the food that had been <unk> or a chef loving a chef loving it , and not just looked or recipes or recipes .
so , please listen when a music is played .
she &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment , where the adults are doing active music , or at least active music , will grow up to a child , and it &apos;s very easy to ask , questions , what color has your flower ?
now , can you play in blue now ?
and the child is playing after a <unk> , rather than a red flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
so that was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step into a interpretation .
and what happens if you play a piece today , this is originally a hundred , <unk> , or even three hundred years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have been <unk> .
there was no piano at the time as an instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the bach would have been excited if he had had the most powerful possibility of modern <unk> .
i can now see the <unk> that bach have had , on the modern wing , to sound what a <unk> <unk> can &apos;t .
also by beethoven , you know he heard more than he had become deaf .
today a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is an orchestra from then being rejected by the time .
that &apos;s why the composers are on us <unk> to reinvent the pieces .
so they become audible by what they have imagined in the mind .
and also , what you would think in in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m talking about today is because what you might have thought of .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
did you know what was jealous ?
and how did this feel like that ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
so if i come from , with my little v w , and i &apos;m going to go wrong , you get this feeling .
i &apos;ll shoot something through your head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to have a big car ?
that &apos;s the first year half of its value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford a little car ?
and then i immediately fall out , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word of justice , this awkward feeling away .
our organism has invented a great method to bring such awkward feelings like envy .
you can also try this as well as revenge or <unk> or something like that .
and i want to tell you something about this mechanism , or what you want to do with this mechanism is something you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism comes from a lie .
but remember , you don &apos;t think about a lie , as you may have heard , when people say , no one has a wall to make the wall .
and then they were <unk> , so he &apos;ll tell you the perspective .
you see a lie in a <unk> that the liars don &apos;t believe the liars .
it turns out it &apos;s easy to check that it has very different in the sense .
it only makes you believe you and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , that they &apos;re doing with themselves .
you need this <unk> to get a <unk> at <unk> .
they can get less easy , yes , <unk> , or <unk> .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
spanish painter <unk> picasso once once .
and this woman was <unk> , the portrait wouldn &apos;t even see her .
picasso answer , wait for them .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
in this place , when you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time they need to experience something that artists can tell us that artists can tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist shares something with , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see , if you just look in the mirror .
the artists , they share with you a portrait of something like that , which you &apos;re only going to be familiar with , if you look at this piece of artwork always .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it may not be similar to you , and it will always be more similar .
so here you have this mechanism where we can use a lie as a great invention for the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , even in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it comes back .
you might know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and they also know how much kind of hostility out of this true spot , the mirror can &apos;t lie from that true spot .
but we should just be familiar with that , that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here it is necessary to see what we understand under <unk> <unk> .
we need to do this a lie that <unk> us that , without which we can &apos;t even live .
we have not only lie in art , in the <unk> , but also in science that &apos;s great .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman of <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
that man should be <unk> by the monkeys and , yes , there &apos;s a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she &apos;d run her to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s not true what charles there is about .
the human being to have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people all the time .
why do we have to prevent people &apos;s knowledge of something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live with these <unk> .
because we &apos;re at <unk> , that feeling of being great , ancestry by the highest creatures , not by such a <unk> , of something like this , which is something like that , like an organism that exists still to a stone , and whatever , it &apos;s like <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we have to prevent people all knowledge of things , especially if they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism out , and what the traces look like , that &apos;s going to lead to something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you one more story .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me .
she came from the school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told you about a student .
a <unk> student .
and she likes to tell him , because he &apos;s got a tendency to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m on the fire department .
and because i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> in this place , there &apos;s something wrong there .
i said to my wife , whenever a human being used to go in a moral place that &apos;s <unk> because we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
and do it once , and then they experience the phrase .
even though i &apos;m on the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel that , that &apos;s the real truth behind us .
this is a little <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there are no <unk> , where we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only second best , the fire department .
he signed up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t say to his teacher , you &apos;d like to put fires somewhere , and you &apos;re excited when the fire after <unk> .
no , it just looks much better , when we show that we &apos;re in charge of trying to remove the dangers of the other , to make the other one when they just put fire .
so here you have this little mechanism .
and those of these <unk> that , in the <unk> , knew that it was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious who &apos;s going to be <unk> right now , without doing something about it , and the things that you know they look very different , that they can look very different for them and others .
so they just start using these words in the language of the politically correct speech .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know , if we &apos;re paying attention , the social circumstances are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
i want to tell you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
according to what logic is that deception , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones we actually know about the unconscious , that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples of this .
the first example sets of what many of you know and some of them appreciate some of them , very few of them .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is such a <unk> , it says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something , which is not <unk> , physical nature .
and if you have people in front of people who are solid belief that they have a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been given from the soul to live in their lives , and then you think it &apos;s like the soul of this a mental framework on it , not from matter , which is the soul of the earth .
and from that soul , you think it &apos;s kind of in this natural nature , in this nature of nature , <unk> , which is <unk> in the latin , which is the <unk> .
and if this guy <unk> over the people , then he &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of what the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to get out of the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something that &apos;s supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have that premise that you have in front of eyes , you understand the logic , which we &apos;re lucky to do is to improve a lie in a lie .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
you know , <unk> , you know .
now this is a <unk> here , which describes a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need a little logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so to lie , that you can just apply this logic to be wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences come out .
the first sentence is , <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put him in particularly pointed it up here .
and the third set , which is immediately up to people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say , who doesn &apos;t have a soul , which is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk , it &apos;s going .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are logical correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic makes no statements about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic makes no statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critically , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our conscious consciousness immediately is that you can do something .
it &apos;s a third set of sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and it does that as if the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and assuming .
because actually we have to prove to whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which it &apos;s easy to use , that two sentences are correct , and it &apos;s a third <unk> that looks like it would have something to do , so we can save our <unk> .
so we do , as if it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of which is filling up the <unk> .
so , you have to think about that , one more <unk> topic , a <unk> out of philosophy .
so this has to do that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was an scholars who was johannes <unk> , and after this is the <unk> <unk> named <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is one <unk> , which is from pure nature .
that &apos;s not that soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you place that exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know where a haystack would go first .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
that &apos;s what the <unk> are imagined .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you put another example , you immediately don &apos;t need a haystack bigger , then he doesn &apos;t need any reason and nothing .
it &apos;s automatically runs the right idea .
if you have this idea that you have kind of driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , from the bigger pile that you put in your mind , you also have a sense of feeling that there &apos;s something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re also in <unk> here in <unk> , i remember the <unk> in brain science .
there &apos;s a <unk> who &apos;s called wolf <unk> , and they say , sometimes , wolf <unk> said , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can go back to the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf <unk> right , he doesn &apos;t have any <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read every day in the daily newspaper , they find it in this third sentence .
and this looks something like that , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , can not be made for its actions and claims , and it &apos;s so <unk> .
you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , you would have to show you if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so , as if the first sentence is wrong in the first sentence , as if you would have to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you just can , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test yourself something like something , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to lie for a lie .
for example , if you meet a person who you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which means prophet .
they can &apos;t call it , that would be a little politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately you &apos;re going to have one , for granted , you know , for granted , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy doing that , you &apos;re not able to prove that you can &apos;t prove that there is no <unk> , the man &apos;s happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he has led them to a <unk> that he doesn &apos;t <unk> themselves .
because actually this person is not really interested in evidence .
it &apos;s only interested in itself , a <unk> need to prove that there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the way of <unk> , you see the brilliance of a lie .
and once again , if you have an opportunity again , you have to feel that <unk> with other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember their <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to ask myself if i can mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and i &apos;ve been wondering if i &apos;m going to take a talk here , and i give up my idea .
i have to be honest , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , i noticed the beginning of my idea .
and i may be thinking of my <unk> that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the two nice girls still , i &apos;m part of the generation that has had this bad image for this bad image , because i &apos;ve already started to study engineering science in <unk> , engineering school , which is what i think you can do .
and then i went to berlin in the <unk> <unk> , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that &apos;s not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they were <unk> all the time , the <unk> was called <unk> .
they &apos;re called <unk> today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or <unk> .
but it &apos;s <unk> like <unk> , which comes out of a hundred watts of the square meter from the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy thing in berlin .
and i &apos;m thankful that he &apos;s got the word again again , because they didn &apos;t have to use the word at all , because everything on the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the <unk> years .
there was the fact that there were <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you thought evil .
the place of <unk> , but it was <unk> and the solar power and solar power , and i started in the <unk> .
and yes , a lot of what i &apos;ve been told today is very , very touch with me , because many , many beautiful expressions , i &apos;ve been through .
i &apos;ve been working 11 years in the collective , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one has no said , it was <unk> , which has a completely <unk> . i have a decade , i have a long time to do it , if i really did my father &apos;s <unk> , because all of the colleagues of my father always <unk> him , because all the colleagues of my father has been <unk> with your child .
it &apos;s all done with there .
and that really was very , very <unk> , and then you come in in such a phase , just showed this an image on <unk> , where i asked myself for 10 years , which were still a thousand <unk> in the collective of that , of course , whether that &apos;s really the great thing .
and i then got it up to <unk> <unk> , and then with friends , i &apos;ve become the <unk> of the company <unk> , which became the <unk> <unk> of one of the greatest <unk> of the world .
one of the things , of course , , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have <unk> , a small group , decided that we &apos;re starting to start and go back and do the next topic of the future , and that means i think it &apos;s a little bit crazy , and that means i think it &apos;s a little bit crazy .
and i brought you with a project i &apos;ve got to imagine you now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask a relatively <unk> story , where you could be able to make a memory of memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are a four and a half thousand people .
they now have a renewables today to 15 percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
this is simply not technological .
if you get more <unk> each other , the system begins to fail .
i &apos;m also telling the politicians , as they &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
they always say why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent of europe , we have the same problems that people have on this island .
and the question was simple , the math was <unk> , had the first contacts to be island , but just calculate .
how big had to be a battery , because it &apos;s a battery that you &apos;re going to be in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go on a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year , by the way , a year is <unk> electrical power in the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear power power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s happening is being erased with diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that goes fast .
you put such a box .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
they &apos;re always waiting for three of the <unk> , two are always waiting .
yes , it looks like this is the burden down there .
we also get very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , the rule is a <unk> system or a system that can only put in small amounts here .
our goal was just to say .
the diesel will be <unk> and the wind , sun , <unk> the burden to map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the diesel .
that means , at that moment , you have to make sure that renewables can take over the entire net .
and of course , you can only do that if they &apos;re doing this in some way here .
that has no one on the world .
so that &apos;s in a little scale , so you can also use your <unk> in the car over a little <unk> .
people are always asking me , what do you do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what you do .
but if you want to have some of these <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re supposed to build a web , and then it becomes very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 to ninety percent renewable , and then there &apos;s the rest here , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable renewable , that &apos;s going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re doing it from batteries .
that will be a energy energy , that hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or <unk> , that will be .
you &apos;d rather have to go to a <unk> and not just <unk> <unk> .
we just wanted to know , what &apos;s a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far does you get there ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
and they have wind and sun and the sun and the burden and came to the result , a very exciting outcome that you need a <unk> system to 50 years from about 50 cents a <unk> <unk> , about <unk> cents a <unk> .
this was the very first calculation six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
well , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper , and we &apos;re cheaper , if the average five percent per year goes up .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what would all be done ?
have negotiate investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brown is the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we &apos;re still 20 percent of diesel , and it &apos;s not <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> on the island , that &apos;s what we find .
and also , we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we &apos;ve decided to build an hall in berlin , which we sort of sort of sort of <unk> the <unk> of the island of one by the scale one to three .
and that means we were looking for the greatest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> is it in the &apos; 70s at the &apos; 70s on the &apos; 70s , and now it &apos;s been developed , and then became <unk> to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a megawatts of performance , and it can bring for six hours of the performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re sort of <unk> around .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as it &apos;s going to be there in the hall , actually , in fact , the complete dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall in the hall , it &apos;s going to look like this , there &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole thing that we simulate the net .
over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to sort of sort of <unk> the net on the net .
and you can see here again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the web .
here we see this again here again again , again , again , this whole , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since <unk> was actually done in the hall , until today , sort of , sort of everything here , which was to develop between the individual system of electronics that we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the theme battery and the theme , and everything in between .
you must , of course , to communicate the battery , you have to be able to communicate to the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about the subject that you &apos;re basically <unk> on this island today , all of the problems that we &apos;re going to get to do if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so , this whole discussion , how is going to be going back to the moment and <unk> , <unk> , how to go to the island , for 30 percent , for <unk> to 30 percent , we wind up the wind and the sun .
and then you know , <unk> is then <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can just start to integrate <unk> , <unk> , can you manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you won &apos;t make that without memory .
you can <unk> through n <unk> , you can do it by <unk> , yes , you should be doing that in any case , the percentage of <unk> , but you &apos;re never going to get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s as an n a little bit .
that &apos;s why many people come and look at this because you can see what problems you get .
when we turn off the diesel , you just don &apos;t have that spinning mass that causes a certain inertia of the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is essentially the <unk> rotating masses of large <unk> mass , where the wave all over europe is like all of europe .
we &apos;re looking at this grid , you see 50 hertz , and if there &apos;s <unk> <unk> nine hertz , we &apos;re going to start a little bit of <unk> <unk> , and then we &apos;ll come back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is amazing .
if you take that somewhere somewhere , it takes a while .
the <unk> rate has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time , you can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that , that spinning mass , then you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> two milliseconds of milliseconds in two milliseconds .
and then you see , there &apos;s a huge amount of energy there .
and the message is , we need to be <unk> on this rotating mass , if we sort of <unk> our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to achieve that at all .
then we have to break down our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is just called the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> at the moment , <unk> from <unk> , because we don &apos;t know , or <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t go .
and we &apos;re just trying to try to understand that the capacity for the capacity to break down is the <unk> capacity , by bringing down electrochemical stores .
now , there &apos;s also a lot of studies now .
and at that point , people will come and look at our <unk> on the way , like our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take a piece of the future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve been doing over the last 30 years .
isn &apos;t there , there &apos;s no such one , <unk> , we &apos;ve never known for it .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of that over the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to store the same capacity over the world over the next 30 years .
it &apos;s going to come .
there will be a lot of <unk> and arguments .
now , the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years that the scientists put on my side .
we &apos;ve got to get over 10 million <unk> , also , to <unk> <unk> now to german networks .
that &apos;s going to take place in april .
so , from that , you know , there &apos;s also a change that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s just about this <unk> to the notion , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
and so far , in discussions , they &apos;re trying to do these <unk> , they &apos;re going to have a small web , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
and the question that the question is , you know , if you &apos;re completely independent from any fossil , or <unk> <unk> that will be <unk> somewhere in the world , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> to them , they &apos;re an island .
and then they just use it to the sun and wind is there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of an <unk> energy supply , and i also &apos;m grateful that they said , solar power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that in that , also , the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you may be a collective and the solar power , and use solar power , a little bit together .
and yeah , i &apos;d just like to encourage you , in the sense , you can be quiet and you can also have a vision .
and you really have to be quite <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , i think , los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless who played on a violin , just two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because from <unk> articles , it was later a book , which was <unk> , with robert lopez , with robert lopez , who <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> at the <unk> , and he had been <unk> by his <unk> career in his <unk> career .
nathaniel left by juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later he lived on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend all of you to read <unk> &apos;s book or look at the film so that they &apos;re not just understanding the wonderful connection between these two men , but how the music has been formed , but how the music is allowed to make that connection , and how they were allowed to get the instrument of the road .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago at walt disney .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and on , like the dodgers never could create in the baseball world , and all of this because of the <unk> passage on the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s symphony .
we came to talk to music . and a couple of days later , i got an email that said that nathaniel were interested in <unk> .
i have to mention that nathaniel would be a medical treatment in the treatment , because he had already been treated with electricity and handcuffed , a trauma , a trauma that has been tracking him .
so , as a result , he &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenic stages . they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he goes away in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , and the horror and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in the same way that a <unk> was a nathaniel , when we first started from walt disney , when we started from walt disney , he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes , and didn &apos;t have lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted him poison .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid that he could sink into one of his conditions , and that i could sink his relationship to the violin , if i started talking about scale and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , i realized that in <unk> eyes , a total complete change .
it was like he stood under the impact of a invisible medicine , a chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger transformed into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a wonder he took his violin , and started to hear some snippets from <unk> to play , and then asked me to end them : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , started by bach over beethoven , created , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t only know a <unk> knowledge about music , but it was also a close personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i could only know about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
using music , he was talking about music , it was from this <unk> , confused man , who was just <unk> through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , at juilliard <unk> , at juilliard <unk> .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him , his thoughts and delusions with its imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> conditions .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music , so that we are in all of us , deep inside us , our feelings , through our artistic lens , can actually form our creativity through our creativity .
and the reality that that expression is coming to all of us and is moving , <unk> and united of us .
so what nathaniel opened , so he brought music back into a community of friends .
the most powerful power of music brought it back into a family of musicians who would recognize his talent and recognized him .
and i &apos;ll always go back to nathaniel music , whether to walt disney <unk> hall or <unk> row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole with the <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> in the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was bred in <unk> to the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the head of the company called , and asked if i could tell you about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this incredible problem for our chefs is , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years we &apos;ve got the ocean fish that we &apos;ve beaten forests bare .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love that the tuna , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;ve collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so probably or evil , <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments . <unk> pollute , the environment , most of them , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the ceo of the <unk> for the company .
we call him don .
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for doing so far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t have the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed from our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> from <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what does you get ? &quot;
sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t say .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to want an event .
now , i <unk> with a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally joined the senior biologists .
we also call him don too don .
&quot; don &quot; i said , &quot; what about sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , waste , <unk> and food . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how much percent of your business use is chicken ? &quot;
it might be two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know what is sustainable to feed chicken ? &quot;
there was a long break on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i <unk> myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have <unk> out of this fish , because , i swear to god who tasted fish after this conversation .
this second fish , which is a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know the better you know your fish , you love the fish the more .
i first ate him in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s made us sort of <unk> .
he came up on the table with a bright white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
hold twice .
it was still delicious .
who can make a fish so taste after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we call it <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least on the way you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on what was essentially wetlands .
they did that by <unk> the land .
they built this complicated suite of channels , and they put my water out of the land and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economically .
and ecologically was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds that are many birds for that place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought green .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally have the levers .
instead of using the water in the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a $ 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and <unk> the <unk> and its company completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they look out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i was there not a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? so there were us and fought us through the wetlands , and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up to my knees , and <unk> keeps a <unk> .
here he picks up a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bundle it to the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent most of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how to have been a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and fall into more <unk> of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head has been weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had at <unk> .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it taste your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat ?
what is the <unk> ? &quot;
now , he &apos;s driving to me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating , what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the plankton zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feeds their animals ?
on the day , i went around on this site with <unk> <unk> , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems like that , &quot; unlike any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment it was , if a director would have asked a <unk> .
and we have around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker of <unk> , which is literally enough to be able to be able to be able to see the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at her <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you do your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> on birds .
now last year , on this site was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest and one of the most important private <unk> in europe .
and i said , &quot; <unk> , is a great <unk> <unk> <unk> , not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker of the belly the better the system the better . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink it . a farm that doesn &apos;t feeds their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
<unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , it shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a town of 240 miles away where the <unk> are better for <unk> .
every morning they go 240 miles to the farm .
and they &apos;re flying 240 miles every night .
they &apos;re doing this because you can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of the penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly for 240 miles into the farm and then fly it out 240 miles a year ?
do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as i had just quoted a song by whitney .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it <unk> . i don &apos;t like it <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m not cooking cooking .
and yet , when i tried to do it in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted it <unk> .
she liked sweet and in it as if you would take a bite .
i mentioned this to <unk> and he &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last way to get into the body .
it has evolved in the evolution of evolution , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feeds their fish , a farm that measures their success on success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he &apos;s enormous , because the water goes through this farm comes in from the river <unk> .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that rivers are rivers now tend to lead to them , chemical pollutants , the drain .
and if it was fought through the system , and that leaves the water is clean , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy ; it cleans the water .
so not only one farm that doesn &apos;t feeds their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but it &apos;s also for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love love , as romantic as though , is also <unk> .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
so what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where food is actually <unk> .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that these are the things that good people know the future , someone says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how will they feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we have enough calories to feed the world more than only .
a billion people are going to starvation today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because it has the logic of our <unk> over the last 50 years .
feed the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , chicken , and all the time has just wondered , &quot; well , if we &apos;re going to feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the easy place . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a industry in <unk> , a craft that makes very quickly <unk> capital to allow that production .
this is no industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
we &apos;re threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile land , not by pump , but by fresh water , not by <unk> , it &apos;s not by <unk> , but not by <unk> and <unk> , but not by fish and nets , but by fish .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable any community to empower yourself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look for the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital and chemistry and machines are <unk> in it , and it never has a really good job of food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that that &apos;s <unk> in two billion years .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
in businesses , who are not worlds for themselves , businesses , to rebuild them , businesses , <unk> , rather than intense , farmers who are not just <unk> , but experts who are not just <unk> .
because they are those who are also experts too .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , that &apos;s me right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to see you today one thing today is that the sum of the data that we consume is more than the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about <unk> , i want you to think about how we can use information to be able to be able to use information , and we see the pattern that would not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> at age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can make accidents of death , we say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes itself .
and that &apos;s because the people who are the most active , and they &apos;re at the <unk> over here .
we can take a step further , and then flow the data and see the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , when we go on to age , we say to age 40 years or younger , accidents are even the cause of the cause people to worry about .
and who &apos;s going to be true , especially with men &apos;s particularly .
so what you see is that this is a way to look at information and data in this particular way of swimming in a living <unk> .
and if we can do this for raw data , why don &apos;t it also be content ?
so what we &apos;ve got here is the <unk> of every single <unk> <unk> that has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk in the rooms .
with <unk> , they can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump right into a particular copy .
now , when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i click on where i &apos;m all spending all spending in these lance armstrong .
now , if i want to just get a <unk> picture , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at the subject of the subject ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and put it back .
now i see greg <unk> .
and that &apos;s how you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , you know , bigger , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t just look or not just <unk> .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took each individual <unk> and reduce it on a little summary .
the summary contains a short look and a symbol of the area that comes out of it .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the popular top .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an idea about the issues that are at wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
well , after i elected government , i know that the <unk> that most of these are meeting at the end of the year is the people of the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just when you take a step back and look at this .
... in a certain of these summaries , i can then get into the subject of time <unk> &quot; people in the year , &quot; people in the year .
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of these are <unk> . some of them come from science . some of them come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all of all ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re surfing on the web as if it &apos;s really a network , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise could be .
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see web pages on it -- and we can bring these <unk> into every single website like this .
so i can take a step back and jump directly to a specific <unk> .
and that &apos;s why , because you just look at these kinds of websites in this way , in this way , the whole <unk> can look at the same way .
so i can go into my process in a certain time frame .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve thought about here .
and i can sort of look at everything i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
and if i take a step back and look at everything , i can redefine my course , perhaps after my <unk> , and here i have been looking for <unk> , right here for bing , or here in live labs .
and from here , i can go to the site and go back to you .
it &apos;s a metaphor that will be used again , and every time it makes the big picture of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking from the curse of the <unk> .
we talk from &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could flip this situation and put the internet on the head , so instead of getting one to the other , we start to go to lots of things , and that actually detect patterns that were otherwise hidden behind ?
if we can do this , it will be a new source of <unk> information .
and , rather than just moving information , we can get out of it .
and if we experience knowledge , then we may even get <unk> from it .
i hear it , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i was driving the bus to school every day , one hour .
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts in different worlds , and in a <unk> way , my deep , voracious curiosity <unk> .
and that curiosity turned out that i was not in school , when i was not in school , walking through the forests of the forests , walked and snakes , frogs and snakes and bugs , and <unk> , everything home and <unk> , all after home .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to figure out the world and explore the limitations of the possible .
and my love science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his amazing shows that we showed us animals and places , and showed a world full of wonder that we &apos;ve never had before .
well , that &apos;s actually good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there is no video games still with the whole imagery with the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen in our heads .
and my response to this was draw and draw from aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all kinds of stuff .
i was constantly caught by the teacher as i was hiding in the front textbook , <unk> .
creativity had to be kind of out .
and this was something interesting about this . what fascinated me about jacques <unk> &apos;s shows was the thought of an entirely unknown world here on our earth .
certainly , i would never have to do an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic as all of the things i had imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided i was 15 to be diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
i wouldn &apos;t let me frustrated by that .
i <unk> my father until he finally made a <unk> in buffalo , new york , just on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i got it only two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , in the age of 40 , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water -- 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in life , as rich as we can &apos;t imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
to this day , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding the same intensity with the same intensity .
so , when i was an adult profession , it was filmmaking .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner drive to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i made comic books all the time .
so films were the way to bring pictures and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i &apos;ve been looking at , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to connect my predilection for the <unk> , and we go to the filmmaking .
so , basically my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we had to do is create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we found at <unk> animation , <unk> .
and what we came up with was the first <unk> <unk> ever in a movie .
this film didn &apos;t have any money to actually play it in the same way the manufacturing costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience all over the world was <unk> from the magic that went from it .
according to arthur clarke , you know , the law is <unk> technology , and magic is not different from each other .
so you saw something magical .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot further .
together with <unk> , we made the guys out of liquid metal there , and the success depended on it just like this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money on the movie .
from those two experiences based on , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , together with my great friend stan winston , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was , the phase analog processes , with visual printers , etc . and to begin with digital <unk> .
and then we did that , and we had a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- what we actually started in the company -- to slow <unk> .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; avatar , &quot; that the bar were written into visual effects and <unk> effects in quite new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that have been made by <unk> , and the <unk> should be <unk> .
but the bar actually pushed back , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not going to be able to do this .
so i shifted that , and i made this other film about the big ship that &apos;s going to end .
i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . it became a <unk> <unk> order , a passionate movie .
but i was secretly trying to <unk> the real wreck of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
and i convinced her , but i said , &quot; we go to the wreckage . we go up the real train .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s going back again that your imagination can create a reality .
so we actually created a reality for six months later in which i put myself in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no <unk> , it was real .
so that really blew my mind .
and the amount of preparation were enormous . we had to build cameras and see all kinds of things .
and i fell on how much these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> more sophisticated planning .
you go into these capsule , and then you &apos;re going into this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is to rescue rescue , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , in part of the part of curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that was not going to give me hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect on , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the <unk> .
at some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had seen before , and the science at the moment when we saw it , we didn &apos;t have a word at all .
so that &apos;s got me right , and i wanted more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice , and i &apos;m going to take a while . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and we were exploring <unk> .
we went back to the winter of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to look at the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
nobody explored the inside of the <unk> , and you didn &apos;t have a means , so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting now on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and you see <unk> , which is quite similar to this <unk> here , and i know that once i &apos;ve played the band there .
and i &apos;m going to fly down with a little bit of a <unk> .
it &apos;s actually just the way i do it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;m physically going to present the titanic .
this was the most <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner of a <unk> , i knew what was going to come up in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was walking around the movie .
and so the set was an accurate copy of the ship blueprints .
so this was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize this <unk> that you &apos;re using such <unk> <unk> , and how your mind can move into the vehicle in this other form of existence .
it was truly profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> to explore something or to do other things , in all kinds of <unk> , which i can imagine as a <unk> .
so after these expeditions , we started what we had seen at the bottom , for example , that <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . that &apos;s kind of aliens , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in the sunlight , as we do that .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees centigrade , they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was back from my childhood again .
and so i ended up with the people who have been interested in space , and they have to do with nasa and they &apos;re sitting in <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go through russia , and they go through russia , and then they fly to russia , and then fly to international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , it &apos;s where i took <unk> to the deep sea .
i took them up with them , and i gave them access to the world at the bottom : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extremes , and i took them to the sources of extreme situations . i took them to take care of the sources , so you could test them and test tools .
we were acting in action , but in fact , science , in fact , is <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as <unk> , then as a child , and the execution of reality .
in the course of this discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but now i &apos;m sure you have to be a director of a director , a leader , like a <unk> or something like that .
but i don &apos;t mind a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing the manufacturing costs , not trace .
all thinking i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have a nails on a towel on a towel .
i &apos;ve all had these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the sake of the challenge of the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that exists . you &apos;re doing it because of the weird connection that comes out of a team that comes into a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working over years for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row on lake .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is the alarm that you have in front of each other because you &apos;ve got a task that you can &apos;t explain any other .
if you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and all the way around , the whole technique , and the difficulties , the human <unk> , when you &apos;re working on lake , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other one , and you know , you can never explain it .
there is a connection , each mutual respect .
so when i came back to make my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i was trying to apply the same leadership , which is that you have his team and being respected , in return to its respect .
and this was really changing the dynamics .
so , i stood back with a small team on a <unk> terrain , and we were doing &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we &apos;ve been to a four and a half years to a real family .
and it changed my way to make films , completely .
there were people who thought we thought we were really <unk> and transported to the planet .
for me , there was more of a more powerful way to do my job , which has changed in the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think at first , i think , the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me come to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me an advice i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t make you yourself .
that &apos;s another one for you . do not do you yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in fact , the arts and the study has to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> there .
not a very important endeavor , in the innovation , has ever been addressed without risk .
you have to be willing to take such risks .
this is the idea that i &apos;d like to give you to be on the way . failure is absolutely an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise , perhaps , because my <unk> with the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds to make the things we need to invent and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact more importantly than any other on the planet .
now , <unk> means that it &apos;s not going to grow over many years , and it &apos;s too much rain , and things are going to change how to withstand their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is terrible for you .
also , the <unk> for them is very important .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of the price , it would be energy from far by far the most effective .
well , the <unk> has fallen over time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the 20th century , and so we have refrigerators , <unk> , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- we &apos;re going to go to a new barrier , and that &apos;s where that barrier has co2 with co2 .
co2 warms up the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the <unk> consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt such rapid changes and collapse .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and that makes <unk> <unk> and where the other consequences are there , there are some of them , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certain ambiguity of how bad they are going to be , but they will be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> several times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t half a quarter or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature will continue to continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say that we have a <unk> truck , which has to bridge under a three feet of a bridge , and you can put it in a sort of <unk> .
this one has to go down to zero .
well , we run a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans are about 20 tons -- people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to change changes that get down to zero .
it &apos;s gone up far up .
only different economic changes have changed it , and we need to go to <unk> increase in reducing and to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a bit of multiplication . you &apos;ve got this thing on the left -- co2 -- that it &apos;s going to be zero , and that &apos;s going to be zero to the number of services , from the service that everyone &apos;s dependent on the service of any service and the co2 , which is <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at each one at each one , and think about how we get it to zero .
it probably has to be very close to zero .
now this is primary algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it takes on nine billion <unk> to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful at working with the new vaccines that are <unk> and <unk> , we could probably reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope by 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes everything , the food we eat , clothing , television , heating .
and that &apos;s very good things and <unk> means to almost everyone on the planet in the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper upper billion , we might be able to do <unk> and use less , but on average , that number will rise to each year and so more than double the services per person per person .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , for efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is really good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
because of different successes in <unk> , through other forms , through new ways in <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of services in the field of energy , there &apos;s a lot of services , their energy for some individual services .
in other services , as you make the manufacture of 30 , 105 times : <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; d &amp; amp : <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of improvements for improvements much smaller .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might have a reduction in reducing a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six or maybe .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe <unk> 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
it turns out to be the question of whether you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every amount of energy for electricity today today , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , when i use the &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and his services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to a lot of these wonders .
normally , there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally you just get wrong , and some of them come from , others .
but in this case , we need to be <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i get out that ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that the notion of people here <unk> up here ?
i remembered that last year , when i got mosquitos , and i somehow liked it .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
that &apos;s what i noticed .
i decided that &apos;s just my <unk> contribution to the environment to be here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you have told me that they don &apos;t bite . they don &apos;t even want to bite the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or multiple of which have unimaginable and unimaginable , and even though there are lots of directions that people are looking for , i &apos;m really just going to see five who can afford these big demands .
i have a tides , and i &apos;m <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
and they may afford a <unk> contribution , and if you &apos;re going to do better than i expect it , it would be great , but my statement here is that we have to work on all those five work , and we can &apos;t give up , because all have significant problems .
let &apos;s just look at the burning fossil fuels first , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is just seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that comes out of the <unk> , <unk> , under pressure , and then you hope that it stays there .
there are a couple of <unk> that can create 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get 100 percent of it , and you get an agreement for the storage of co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it make sure ?
who can guarantee what literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough thing .
next : <unk> .
they also have three big problems , and the cost , especially in <unk> countries , and the question for safety is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human cooperation , the fuel doesn &apos;t use for guns .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work on .
the last three of the five , i put them in .
it &apos;s the renewables that they &apos;re called often .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the density that these technologies are generating dramatically than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about a lot of <unk> , 1,000 times more surface than a normal power station .
also , these sources are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to drop every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t move all the time .
that &apos;s why you have to be , if you &apos;re addicted to these sources , the energy in times when it &apos;s not available to you .
so there &apos;s a lot of things here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say , for example , that the energy source is beyond the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you need to have the risk that the energy from where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and in order to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , cell phones , <unk> , for everything , and i found that all the batteries that use , and i found that all the batteries that we produce now , to be less than 10 minutes of <unk> camps .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to get 20 percent of them -- 30 percent of the rest of it .
if you want to support 100 percent on it , they need incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we come to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that are working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many , you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many people who are involved in there .
bill big has several companies , among other things , one called the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i funding a company , which may , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
so the evolution has stopped in this industry ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts lying around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never be able to simulate whether it &apos;s going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes , you know , it looks like it &apos;s going .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can even use the waste from today as <unk> .
instead of breaking your head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium becomes incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that there &apos;s a kind of pillar , often as a &quot; <unk> wave reactor . &quot;
this really solves the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent , you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
the <unk> u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> cheap and simply <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to go forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
a lot of talking about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , and there are still an agriculture , and hopefully it &apos;s going to clean up and cement to that way .
so in order to reach those 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , completely change .
the other note is whether we &apos;re using the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a key element of this <unk> .
if we go back there , what should the 2020 look like by 2020 ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use <unk> to get reduction on the way , and the less we get down , the less it will be lower , and it &apos;s also the temperature .
but in fact , this note to the things that we &apos;re doing is not fully to the big <unk> , or even something less important , or even less than the other , which is the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
we have to track these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure that in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this topic .
al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david <unk> energy <unk> energy . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework that can be discussed wide , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
this is a very <unk> wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without the co2 , i would take this wish to take a wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it &apos;s going to be awful between the long term and the short of people , between the united states and china , between poor and china , and almost all of these are life life , and almost all of these two billion are going to be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use for more funding .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the kind of <unk> money that these innovative approaches for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to make dialogue <unk> and complete , and also the things that are being done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first of all , you can give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation of a supercomputer , to do all of the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re only in the <unk> million .
the hard step is building the first <unk> , to find another billion , the <unk> and the place of actually building the first one .
and as soon as the first finished , if it &apos;s going , as i promised , it &apos;s all right , because the economic density is so different from how we know it .
so to understand this really , that means building deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column , it uses <unk> , and then the process starts to work on , and then the process goes up and works down ?
<unk> : right . now you have to <unk> the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and many of the controls that can go wrong . this thing is where you open it and do things like it , and it &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can take it for 60 years -- think of a column -- think about a column without the entire complexities .
and it &apos;s there , and it &apos;s burning 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which is a solution to the trash .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the trash : you can let him sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- you take it up and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already there that exists in these <unk> or <unk> , that &apos;s our <unk> .
so this is what these reactors have been a problem , which is what we put in our fill in and so that the process is going to dramatically reduce the process .
but while you &apos;ve talked about these opportunities with different people of this world .
where is the biggest interest in which it really can do ?
<unk> : now we &apos;ve never set up on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for everything that is wearing &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s been a great interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been watching the <unk> and talked about how this is <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , so anyone who has done a very fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , time and likelihood of doing something like this ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent , and then for 20 years .
this is sort of a deadline that we &apos;ve got to show us the <unk> .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could it be easy .
and fortunately today , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of things , so if their approach works that can work for their pilots to work for their pilots .
and it would be the best if it &apos;s multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the great breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would have been without the <unk> , but they do so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there &apos;s other innovative companies .
you know , we know their work not as good as these , but there are the modular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe it &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about this is that a million times a million times as much energy as one , say , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint and other things , is the power of footprint and other things , almost in a single league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to have a <unk> driver to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much , and you &apos;re in front of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something like that .
now , there &apos;s a design network that &apos;s called <unk> , which is dealing with various techniques to <unk> the warming , so that we &apos;d get 20 or 30 years longer for us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you should not work on insurance , because that may not work that you &apos;re going to eat , because you keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you have the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a conversation in <unk> about whether you should have that , if things come faster , or that innovation needs more than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are very different camps .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that are going to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things you can actually say , where there &apos;s a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is like aids in aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems to invest in something that you just later -- and it comes to the investment that doesn &apos;t necessarily be so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst report , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world .
the fact is that uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic economic , and at the same time , the skeptics would go away , then the skeptics will say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it , that it &apos;s no co2 , i wish that it &apos;s cheaper , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper .
and that would be their answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you use all of that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals are suffering from all of the other goals , the <unk> , that are doing a stupid waste of resources , to invest in better things that we can do .
<unk> : now , the actual spending for research -- we should spend 10 billion per year than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
they don &apos;t have other things underneath that .
you get to big <unk> , and you can disagree with a reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and tries to fund that . for me , there &apos;s most waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> , and it &apos;s funded only the learning curve , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much more expensive .
if you have the <unk> that you get , it &apos;s a very high <unk> , you can only get the rich up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinking .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why don &apos;t we have been talking more about research ? &quot;
it &apos;s still still because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that that &apos;s a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to get the <unk> .
and this is a set of thoughts i think .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that will be supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> has to have to have a maximum highest structure with 20 spaghetti , about <unk> tape , <unk> tape and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually really hard because people are pushing to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task that makes deep sensations in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them .
usually most people are starting to do with the task itself .
you talk about it , you think about what it looks like , it &apos;s <unk> .
and then invest a little bit into planning and organization , and they &apos;re drawing and we put spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> structure .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have any time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and you put it gently down to the top , take a step back and <unk> ! let me admire your work .
but then , almost always , what happens is that it &apos;s going to be &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> causes the whole thing to <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; <unk> &quot; as others , and under the <unk> are <unk> .
they lie , they lie , they &apos;re confused , and they make really <unk> shapes .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and the best ones are new graduate students .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
and as we did peter , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering : how is that ? why ? what about them ?
and peter tells : &quot; none of the kids spend a lot of the head of spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find a proper plan , ok .
and then they realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow up to the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> do is they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have a lot of <unk> prototypes .
<unk> can see this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> .
and you try to try and get the kids immediate feedback , and what &apos;s not .
so the performance , working with prototypes , far -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of them is about <unk> , they create half of it , in fact , half of it , lawyers , are better than adults are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
three is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build robust structures .
ceos are a little bit on average . but this is what it &apos;s going to be interesting .
if you put a <unk> administrator on the team , you &apos;ll better significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they conduct the process ; they understand it .
and that team that water down and on work will watch the performance of teams significantly improve significantly .
specialized skills and <unk> and the combination of success lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , you get about six , who have robust structures .
i tried something exciting .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the <unk> .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize for the winners .
what did you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if anyone had built a <unk> tall construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we went through this practice with the same student .
what happened now ?
now they understand the benefit of the prototyping .
so , from the same , bad team of one .
they produced the highest construction at least .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you might ask , why would someone actually invest time to create a <unk> ?
and the reason is , i &apos;ll help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and creating <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> does is , it helps you hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or a common language , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , you know , <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples from all the world how people optimize the system and <unk> the system .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it demands that we all have our senses on the task , and that we think we &apos;re using our thinking optimal , like our feelings and what we &apos;re doing in the challenge that lies in front of us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all required to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s pretend we &apos;re a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine , <unk> machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to be in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they were going to choose , because i &apos;ve often asked this question recently , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or twitter or &quot; america is the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that somehow you &apos;re drawn to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet are not going back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever on this planet , no matter what scale they use : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never before this .
my <unk> died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents gave my grandparents to <unk> .
my parents are the 80 <unk> .
so there should be better at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born today in new delhi is expecting to live as long as the richest man in the world in 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they have formed the demographics in the earth in a way that doesn &apos;t have any war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we <unk> them . <unk> .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have yet been threatened by only one generation .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed , our ability to feed billions of people , are the benefits of science .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , it &apos;s going to change if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world go to bed every day .
that number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> the world .
drinking water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we &apos;re not from that chaos , we disappear .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t have at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is keeping me awake at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m awake at night . we &apos;ve never been doing scientific progress yet .
and we &apos;ve never been able to be able to be able to do it as we can do it today .
we &apos;re at the verge of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet , i really think we have to go back hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we fight through these kinds of things , where we &apos;ve got these kinds of things over now .
people are spinning themselves in their faith and so closely that you can &apos;t free them out .
not even the truth will free it .
and listen , everyone has a right to think of his mind , even a rather thought of progress .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t quite have their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at resistance , in resistance to what , at the end , which is the most effective health activity in the history of mankind .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i do , i wrote an article and drove on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were a particular kind of <unk> <unk> in the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we are rich , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
but i couldn &apos;t worry about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these <unk> that were crazy at all , they were not fanatics .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that sort of <unk> me .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as earlier .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about it , with a little quote , with a little quote : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that .
you can just call some names , and you &apos;ll just call people .
chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they &apos;re always right , so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask you evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now it &apos;s : if you have to get evidence of that evidence , you &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that for the reason that we now live in an epidemic of fear that i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
there &apos;s plenty of studies to see if this was true .
in tons of studies , they should be done , that &apos;s a serious deal .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , in england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all equal , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we think we think we see what we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of photographs of a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
devastating because of the fact that the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which the family population is falling for measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do this .
because this is a t.b. here ?
has one in the audience ever die about measles ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can put it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and walk around and <unk> messages like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because they can &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never is the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst human beings in humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle are not so much .
it &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed a <unk> .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
now , that &apos;s good , except that paul <unk> and vaccines talk about vaccines and says that the value are , and that people are simply <unk> to <unk> .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell you without arms of sentinels .
he gets home <unk> , because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take them away , go back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they will not only die to measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i think i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against <unk> . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s somebody in lagos morning in lagos , and you &apos;re going to los angeles , at the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a couple of hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love it , we lie . we love that .
do you take all the vitamins tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to leaps on .
i know you did this because half of americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative to alternative , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data takes it all the time .
they make their urine . they almost never do it .
that &apos;s okay , they want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and <unk> itself to us that can afford .
so we &apos;re going to run out , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really serious , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , was <unk> , we don &apos;t even know what this is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars doing it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , people &apos;ll shout me up and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s make people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me , whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to have the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if they &apos;re entering this way , where believe and magic evidence and replace science , they get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he &apos;s got 400,000 his people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , that we know they can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths from a country that will be <unk> worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t please tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they &apos;ve always been . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> genetically genetically engineered food and <unk> food .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , every branch , each of the <unk> , has changed by people .
you know , there was no <unk> of paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did all this .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work and some of it .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more closely . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re just dislike changed food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear all the time is to lots of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid it &apos;s a dead end , and it keeps millions of people from the world .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ? genetically modified food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of stuff , like cassava .
it &apos;s something that will eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s about the potato .
it &apos;s just a street . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , and scientists are building all this right in there .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to this is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , i mean , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , unprecedented food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s getting time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far , we &apos;re guilty of something that we do , i think , not guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not worthy , and we have to really stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might like to say , &quot; do you want to go into this ridiculous time time and to the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want that in any case .
right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them , where we want to <unk> them , and we will move them where we want .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go to the time machine , and we &apos;re going to go into the future , and we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it may seem strange , that a magician was interested in a magician , unless you look at it as i am , &quot; a deception that will be real , if someone has only noticed enough . &quot;
in other words , <unk> in some studies have shown a measurable effect in some studies , which is because it &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to you , is a <unk> or a kind of ... in <unk> , for example , there &apos;s a <unk> effect in the body that &apos;s called the <unk> .
a deception is real , because somebody perceives it so .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that at least since the 1950s is in every <unk> for children .
i even learned him from <unk> <unk> magic &apos;s magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand you can study .
i just get the knife in my hand .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of it , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time to move anything , as long as i &apos;m doing here , nothing can go into my sleeve , or get out of my sleeves .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will hold through my bare physical magnetism .
in fact , it &apos;s so stuck in his place that i can shake it , without your knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve , or comes out , no <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> a little kids , which is magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
now , many of you are familiar with this trick in the room .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i <unk> my wrist to make sure nothing in my sleeve , or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i <unk> my wrist , is that there is the secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i <unk> my hand by the back , so you see them from the back , this fingers here , just from where he was in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who doesn &apos;t have childhood .
so he &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t know that there are only three fingers down here , because the minds and the way it process information is not one by one , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but that &apos;s what it doesn &apos;t really happen . and then i open my hand .
of course , it will be held there , but not by magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is going to happen by putting me out through this movement that the finger <unk> .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can run this trick with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the <unk> ?
one year ago , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
it turns out , if you offer a placebo pill to a white pill , in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a particular measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you give against placebo , for example , you can change a smaller pill , and change that blue , and you color a characters on it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although none of those <unk> -- they &apos;re just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me freak out .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not all .
when you take capsules , it &apos;s more effective than every shape .
a colored capsule on one end and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the dosage is a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is .
-- that &apos;s also a role of a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab on the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected to a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s a lot more powerful than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t appear as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t appear as good as a capsule , it doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
and none of it has any really <unk> property . it &apos;s just our belief in it that made us a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that obviously is a deception , and let it look real .
and we know from that study that you have to reach towards the needle if it &apos;s supposed to reach to the needle .
this is a 18 inch <unk> . it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to start with you a little bit earlier .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m now going to stick this needle into my skin and pull through them , until she <unk> on the other side .
if you fall evil , if you drop away -- i showed this one night in in the hotel room , and some of the people i didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman , almost powerless .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you &apos;ll look away for the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same , but you can also <unk> if you want .
so it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin , and on the other side , again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at <unk> .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
now .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not as dumb and <unk> itself , just to talk to us for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what looks like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the <unk> are coming in now .
so let me just show you from near .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can do it .
sorry . if you &apos;re <unk> , look away , don &apos;t look .
the people behind the back , or the ones that later look at the video later , say , &quot; well , this looks quite impressive , but if it was real , he would -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and there if it really was , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me take a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
now i would take the needle out now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think , in this scale , and the purpose of making a real thing from a deception , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to face a few times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re excited about it . thank you very much .
everybody is talking about happiness today .
i have a couple of people in the number of books that have been published with happiness , in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest in happiness at happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but in spite of all of these tides of work , there are several cognitive ones that are kind of impossible to be able to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s true for <unk> that are going to think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because it turns out that we &apos;re just the mess , like everybody else .
the first one of these <unk> is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could narrow it down , but in the big and whole , this is something we need to give up , and we will have to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a case of experience and memory : basically , you &apos;re going to be between happiness in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about the fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact about the well-being without information .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my lectures , who said a story . he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was absolutely a <unk> sound .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , has ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what had ruined it was the memories of experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
she didn &apos;t care because he was with a memory of <unk> ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what this really says is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , can be able to experience the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor &apos;s <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt when i &apos;m doing you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that the <unk> and the history of our life is given , and it &apos;s the one that where he says the physician is , &quot; how did you felt lately ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two of them are part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really begins with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we &apos;re not just telling stories , if we make ourselves to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep in our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients , which is a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds on her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who in two has more suffered ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had had to be patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did this patients do ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a lot had much worse <unk> on the <unk> .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is worse than the others .
and the thing that &apos;s worse is where the pain was at the end of his peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from view of the <unk> self , b clearly had a worse time .
well , what you could do with patient a do , and we actually have clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s going to work , you know , you could actually increase the <unk> of a patient by just rolling up the tube .
that will lead the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you can do that the <unk> itself is a <unk> , and it has to do that the <unk> itself is a much better off , because now you &apos;ve given a patient a better story about its experience .
what &apos;s a story about ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that people give us , and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
and so what a story is about is and a story of <unk> are changes and end .
you &apos;re very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
now the <unk> self lives his life continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and they ask : what about these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i do it -- they know the psychological presence as about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them . in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 , most of them behind them .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet , they kind of get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during these moments of life .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we consume while we are in the world .
and as we use it to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first one , the <unk> vacation is twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s what doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> self , there &apos;s no better vacation better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , the critical variable is actually the critical variable that is different from a <unk> self . time has very little influence on this story .
now the <unk> self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who , say , have two <unk> on two different surgeons , and decide what to choose , then the vote that memory has less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of self itself , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which sort of , the <unk> themselves , through experiences that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we were on vacation , this is a very common case , which is , we <unk> <unk> in the service of itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify .
i mean , how much do we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think on a holiday that we &apos;ve done in antarctica a few years ago , who was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often in proportion to how often i think about other <unk> .
and i probably have my memories on this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever open the folder with 600 pictures of it , i spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and it &apos;s more than a year and a half .
there seems to be an disagreement .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i can have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you do more of them , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight . why do we give memories so much weight ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the <unk> , all of your images are wiped out , and you get a <unk> drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between the two types of self and you have to think about how they choose that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about the sense of time , you &apos;re going to have an answer , and if you think of memories of the sense , you could get another answer .
why we pick up the <unk> that we choose to pick up is a problem that makes us with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the lives of the <unk> themselves ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from the <unk> self over time .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person , if this person thinks about your life .
very different .
everybody who doesn &apos;t separate these terms is going to be different from happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being , and i &apos;ve got a lot of researchers about happiness for happiness for happiness long .
the distinction between happiness itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a major survey survey that has been asked over half a million people to ask about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about happiness in the two ways of self .
and the main lesson we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how someone &apos;s happy with his life , and that really teaches you how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the relationship is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you &apos;re going to meet someone , and you would say , oh , your father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you would know about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what the <unk> happiness is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly being happy with people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize yourself , you &apos;re going to maximize very different things .
so the conclusion from what i said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a replacement replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think of happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the right answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people have to be happier in california when they are , say , in ohio .
and what &apos;s happening is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could pull back to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , which is what happens to people who are moving to california in hope to become happier .
now , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to remember how terrible the weather in ohio , and they feel that they have made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we were talking a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup poll .
is this something that you can let us share because you now have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the gallup poll that we &apos;ve found in the gallup poll that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect .
we found that in terms of happiness in the <unk> itself .
if we were looking at how emotions vary with income .
and it turns out that under the income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they become increasingly less and less happy as the poorer will be .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i have rarely seen so flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t leave a business attack , but lack of lack of money on it , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
and the more money you make more of you better .
that &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , the entire american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on the head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that a politician , that the country would generally take a <unk> look like serious and make politics based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s <unk> for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will be slow down in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , you &apos;re happening right now and in other countries .
people are there , recognizing that you should think happiness if they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will have to discuss whether they want to explore <unk> , or whether they want to explore <unk> , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon .
as you &apos;re lucky enough to be very different depending on how they think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you &apos;re <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s going to be part of the national statistics in the next decade or two .
well , it seems to me , or should at least be the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to try to save the world in the reality , how to save the world in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing games with playing games .
we &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time when you think how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
in fact , in my research at the institute of the future , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase the time dramatically .
i calculate that the time it takes time at 21 billion hours a week .
and that seems to be a little bit more <unk> at first , so i &apos;ll repeat it to work : if we want problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , climate change and obesity , i think we need to do , play online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes quite exactly why i believe that games are so critical for survival of human species . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he was building a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic words in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , a little fear , but also very much concentration , really deepened into solving a really difficult problem .
and if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here , which is <unk> eyes , and the mouths are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows will be surprised .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so extremely positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when they reach it , they shocked them to actually be able to do that . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is just a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces around the world , if we take the barriers to the next century , and the face of those who are facing the opposite of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see more of this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; life &quot; in life i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m like , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was studying where i was in my thesis in my ph.d.
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s all .
we &apos;re doing more <unk> . i mean very good at the context of the motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired by collaboration .
if we are in a <unk> , i think that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime , to be helpful to solve the problem , as long as you need to try and try again .
and in reality , if we fail , when we hit obstacles , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings , when we play games , they simply don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just reach anything ?
how can we bring these feelings out into reality ?
so i looked like games like world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment , which offers the ideal environment .
and i found a couple of things that epic happen in <unk> &apos;s possible .
so , first , when you get into one of this <unk> , particularly in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and it immediately goes away .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect in your current level , right ?
so they can do that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have to work , but there are no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you &apos;re like <unk> . there are always something important to do .
and there &apos;s plenty of staff .
so where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to end up their epic mission .
this is not so simple in the real life , that feeling that there is a lot of thousands of employees .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re based on &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + a strength , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
that constant feedback is not in true life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have : + 1 and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 <unk> idea .
i &apos;m not going to get that feedback in real life .
so , the problem of <unk> like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;d rather spend our entire time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> has spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started to walk upright .
so the first <unk> primate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend now with play right now , it just makes sense when you think about the scale of the human development development , which is extraordinary .
but it also appropriate . because it turns out we &apos;re using all these time on play , and actually change what we &apos;re going to be able to do as humans .
we &apos;re developing too collaborative , very creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
look at this interesting statistics that recently been published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young human being spent 10,000 hours today in a country with strong <unk> , with <unk> to the 21 .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , hours of the exact exact <unk> they spend in school , they spend in school at five times the high school -- if you never miss .
so , we have a complete <unk> here , where young people are learning as well , which means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have this new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research that &apos;s been based on the <unk> &apos;s research , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the most advanced study of any subject to the 21st year , we &apos;re going to be <unk> in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people that are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players doing ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been able to have human potential before .
so many people are now in the world that at least an hour spend a day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which are extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> evolved to save the energy and work on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , with the players around the world , in particular in india , china , brazil can play online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it &apos;s like to master these games .
here &apos;s four things that i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do immediately , to do a hurdle , and we have to believe that we have an educated hope to succeed .
player always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth trying to try and try to do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the poet of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people more , after we played with them , even when they played with them .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that there &apos;s a time to have a time with us to spend the rules that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we &apos;ve got the same goal to the <unk> .
so the <unk> allows the <unk> of ties and trust and one another .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> , 22 hours plays a week , as a <unk> <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier in working hard when we relax or not do anything .
we know that as human beings , we know that as human beings , we get hard to do great work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it to be part of <unk> missions of <unk> missions .
here &apos;s a <unk> to back that to the right light . you certainly know wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest on the world , at almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft , on the internet of warcraft than any other <unk> subject in every other wiki .
they create a epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome , players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is they think you can change virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to see less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit <unk> .
so he says that it actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life .
they can make stronger social ties in a real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in the real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than real .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to begin to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years of <unk> .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
there were <unk> <unk> .
and these were the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient greek <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , games were games , more specifically , in the kingdom of famine during famine .
there were such a great famine that the king of <unk> decided to take a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it needed to be an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so deep into the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and <unk> us with <unk> , <unk> productivity surrounded , they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived the famine , by eating one day and ate the next one day .
i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games to escape the suffering from the real world .
we &apos;re playing games to everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not satisfying in the real life , and we get what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
the <unk> didn &apos;t get the famine better , so the king decided , the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> , and the winner were allowed to break into a single adventure .
they went out and they went to search for a new home , and they just let them go back so many people to survive , and they were looking for the rest after an area where they were thriving .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> shows that the <unk> , which was later the roman empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
and so scientists came to the notion that the <unk> story actually is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global impact that took almost 20 years that the famine could explain .
so this crazy story could vote .
you may actually saved their people through play , by spending 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> and so much about playing with each other , that they learned to save the entire civilization .
so we can .
we &apos;ve done since 1994 warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time of the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they had been <unk> for 18 years , and we had been warcraft for the 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be <unk> that half of us spend an hour with play a day , until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? &quot; and this question i &apos;ve been doing my work in the institute for the last few years .
we have this flag in our office in palo alto , and it expresses how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best possible outcome , and then people will empower this idea to make this notion of reality .
we &apos;re starting to epic wins , and we give people the possibilities to achieve .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people &apos;s epic wins in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it will be realistic for them , and you actually live your real life without oil . so , if you sign up to the game , tell us where you live , and then you &apos;ll get <unk> in real oil .
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go from oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going on .
find out how to survive , most of our players have <unk> habits in the game .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next <unk> game , and higher objective than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game called <unk> at the institute of the future .
now , starting with the point of view , the computation is that the people have only been 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to the player , to sign up , we &apos;ve made almost like a <unk> <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where you have the <unk> , you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together , you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , security , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we put on the third three march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when they end the game , they get the <unk> , &quot; social engineering , &quot; in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all of sub-saharan africa and invite them to learn social redesign .
we have a comic book . we understand &quot; level high &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , the benefit of it , the benefit of their own social enterprises , to save the world .
i get to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think what happens next ?
we have these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope that you agree with me that gamers are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to knit close social nets , <unk> and desire for a sense of meaning .
i really hope that we play play games on this planet to survive another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design this game and play with me .
if i &apos;m going to go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure for two things , that we can create every choice of the future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so , i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what a couple of months ago in writing an article on <unk> wired .
i used to write my <unk> at the end , but i was the process of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life in my life , which really means &quot; disabled &quot; .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , helpless , useless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , strong .
i looked up at this list a friend of reading , and they had to laugh at all , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came up until the <unk> , and i didn &apos;t have to stop reading , and i had to end up with this <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> old <unk> , and i just thought the copy has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a edition of the early &apos; 80s when i was just at the elementary school , and i started to build my sense of self outside of my family sector , and also shape the other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use any <unk> .
if i was born to this post , i was born into a world that somebody like me to see a person whose life can run positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to have the opportunity and adventure .
so , i &apos;ve just navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and i expect me to find a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words in the last two words , under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with this words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the pronunciation is a big force , because what you &apos;re looking at as well as <unk> can also be <unk> .
so , what do we actually want to <unk> -- one disabled man or a powerful people ?
just as a child , just to call a child , could be enough , <unk> them and <unk> them .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open up the doors ?
one person who opened up the doors was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> whose name , as you can think , most americans don &apos;t know correctly , and so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always very colorful flying , and it was just created for the work with children .
i found the time i &apos;ve spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i would seem to be repeating some of the things that would seem to be repeat with this thick , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated these <unk> more than everything else . i hated it .
and imagine , in front of me as a <unk> child with dr. p. and so trying to stop these exercises , <unk> without success .
and one day , he was watching me in one of my practice -- these were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , <unk> and young girls , you &apos;re going to tear one of these tapes .
and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that richest five-year-old girls are going to be in the hospital ward , but he actually brought me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes .
and i wonder today , how much his vision of me was shaped as strong and powerful young girls , and i could imagine , as one of nature from strong , powerful and human being .
this is just one example of how adults can make a child in <unk> .
but as you already have <unk> examples out of the <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t make us space to imagine what we all want to wish to do , to enable each one to make yourself a powerful human being .
our language , our language , the social changes behind , that have been triggered by a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the <unk> of titan , <unk> out of titan and artificial <unk> for aging body that allows people to do , really all of their opportunities , and set over the limits that allow them to be given to their own way , to create a natural identity .
so , maybe this technology looks more clearly , because the fact that there was always another truth , which is that every human society can give something very <unk> and very <unk> , and the human ability can adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable with the questions of people to answer , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people .
this set of <unk> lives from the idea of the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , not to master a challenge , which is as if my life was so successful , because i could avoid the possible one of life in a prosthetic way , or whatever people are avoiding me .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing , of course , of course , from the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically emotional or emotionally , or even both .
and i claim that that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a obstacle that we need to have to be able to do to make our lives better .
<unk> are just among our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
and sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but he &apos;s all the time with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the effect of the impact , or the <unk> of a human <unk> .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just a real thing , and it &apos;s just a different person to do it , but the question is not , whether we &apos;re going to be clear to the <unk> or not , but how we get it out .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that , the people we love to preserve in front of <unk> , but they &apos;re also preparing to get it out of it .
and we don &apos;t like to do our kids , if we give them feel like they can &apos;t adapt .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things to clear : to be a medical fact , and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and in fact , to be honest , the only one and permanent disability , which i &apos;ve had to put apart with , is that the world is always able to describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are at the heart , and the cold to put hard truth about their medical forecast , or even put a forecast of the quality of life that you expect , we have to pay attention , that we &apos;re not going to be disabled that someone is actually disabled .
maybe this is the current concept that looks at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we repair that , for every single one of a larger disability , a greater disability .
if we don &apos;t treat people holistically and not all of its forces and possibilities and recognize , we can create in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to have , another disease .
we <unk> a person who has value for our society .
so we have to focus on the <unk> and look at all of the human possibilities .
the most important thing is that there &apos;s between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> connection .
we should not be able to <unk> these days or deny them , and we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor should we return them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about the most important opportunity .
i think it may be more about to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to hug it , to give you the <unk> , to put them on the <unk> , and maybe get to dance .
and maybe we can do it as a matter of natural and <unk> and useful , and they don &apos;t feel so troubled by their presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . anniversary of charles darwin , and when he wrote over 150 years ago , darwin &apos;s got darwin , in my eyes , in some very real way in the human character .
i would use it to be -- not the most powerful of its species , and also not the <unk> of its way , but the ones that change changes best .
conflict creates creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> , from the struggle of human mind , is determined by conflicts .
so again , change and customization are the greatest skill of people .
and maybe we know what wood is carved out of , when we &apos;re actually going to be tested .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> stand for a change we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we were doing ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal normal .
there are the common . the typical . but not the normal one . and if you &apos;re going to know this poor , gray person , you really want to learn if they really were ?
i think not more .
it would be great if we can do this paradigm of normal , or the strength , to make it even a little bit more dangerous , exchange , so we can release the forces of very many children , and they invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
<unk> found that we &apos;ve always been finding people from members of our society : useful to be useful , to be useful .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals were already 60,000 years ago , and they have older people and people with heavy physical injuries , and that might be because the <unk> <unk> of these people was valuable for society .
they don &apos;t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the <unk> of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and i see the older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you won &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i went to her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , you know .
and then , of course , it &apos;s made it click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man , which i knew just from narratives of my mother &apos;s tales about this day , because i , of course , on my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for medical diagnostics was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my legs had taken up after you , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot he had to <unk> the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never walk , and never might be as mobile as other kids or that you could never have an independent life , and then they just lie me . &quot;
so , really extraordinary , i found that he had collected my entire childhood , no matter whether i had won in the second grade in the second grade , if i had a little bit of <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , whether i had these little snippets or one of my graduate students , and he used these little snippets to teach his students , <unk> out of <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of the human willing .
you just can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor of life can be the quality of human beings .
and dr. <unk> kept telling him , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if you don &apos;t always say something else all the time , and if you just get a bit of support when you get kids themselves , you can get kids a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with it , two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve been thinking about the course of time , if you were asked me at age 15 , whether i had my <unk> <unk> of meat and bones , then i wouldn &apos;t have <unk> .
i really wanted to be normal then .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s what happened because i have experienced something with my legs and not even though that experiences .
and perhaps this change could happen , because i &apos;ve encountered so many people who have opened up the doors instead of people who cut me , and i wanted to make an idea .
you see , it really takes one person to demonstrate how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you open it to someone , your own , inner forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you open it , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a door for those people to be a very good teacher .
they &apos;re bringing them to the doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential .
again , what potential do we want to do now ?
in the 1960s , in the &apos; 60s , a case study conducted , in britain , they were transformed into <unk> .
what they call &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students will be divided after grades .
and the a student will get <unk> <unk> , and the better teachers get .
they then gave me over a <unk> period of college students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; on the grade , &quot; they were told that they were very smart , and after those three months , they were actually written .
and of course it actually breaks the heart to hear that the other thing was said to the <unk> , they &apos;re only enough .
and then it was the same way after three months .
but only those who were still in school -- aside from the students who had thrown out school .
so the key thing in this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just told you that are the <unk> , and that &apos;s enough for the class of the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only disability is a <unk> mind , a mind that &apos;s broken , has no hope , and he finds nothing more <unk> about it . it &apos;s not lack of our natural ability , <unk> <unk> and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we do it , we can continue to support the human mind , to continue to hope and find yourself and other people around themselves , and then we put our forces really positive .
if you have a mind with these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem called <unk> in the 14th century called <unk> in the 14th century , and my friend jacques <unk> told me , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that , in a few changes of changes in genes , could have a better memory -- more precise , more accurate and faster .
or you want to be <unk> , more powerful .
do you want to get more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always <unk> after more creativity .
what would you like most like ?
what would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a couple of them . probably about as many as creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to choose a good memory ?
a few more .
what about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do that as a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a completely different world .
is this all a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> subject here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor &apos;s view of the subject .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn your <unk> out , take your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn <unk> &apos;s book , which is about being wrong , and maybe you can throw it wrong .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other <unk> , or is it too ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the <unk> on the tops of the branches , they have survived , it has survived ; it has survived in its environment ; it demos its environment .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is of course what we &apos;re most interested in .
we twigs to modern chimpanzees to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period of time , there might be 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re right away from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually the basic mechanisms , the fundamental mechanisms we &apos;re doing is quite equal .
is it clear that we can use it , and we can use the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human model that &apos;s used to treat a diabetic for a diabetic ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> of what comes from the pancreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , is that any of us in your gut is that each of us in our gut will lead more bacteria than it leads to the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think if antonio damasio asks you , thinking about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all nutrients that they could only want to do without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way of bacteria , with occasional <unk> of unintended <unk> , <unk> <unk> push .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help it , you can try to nutrients from organic nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a form of a species ?
or are we supposed to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back in the big bang at 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , perhaps before three to four billion years ago , on earth -- and then the human species , perhaps as 800 to a billion years , and then the human species , which shapes over the last <unk> years .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , the life on earth is only in <unk> , the animal kingdom , like a single one , and the human life , a small <unk> .
that &apos;s what we were .
this also represents the <unk> of this speech , so i hope that d ate it .
now , when i was a <unk> at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i asked , something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , divide every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell in both <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms showed up , things started to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that will <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of our body could be in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , having sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable for sex -- but with every year , it has come to my increase .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns that in las vegas show his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautifully <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the conclusion that as a doctor , i was going to have a destination that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , only different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about beyond the relationship of the genome to the next generation , customization and survival generation .
so , from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;ve developed like <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit , to fall into the sea .
and i think we &apos;d all be able to have the mood , the woody allen , to have the idea of the phrase , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to swallow immortality .
i want to do it by going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are <unk> , and by doing the hot steam , otherwise if fish were there , there would have a vacuum of cooking a vacuum , and they &apos;ve been able to do it in a <unk> environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space , the people in evolution , and most of all the way we <unk> into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we can &apos;t move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for this would be that we &apos;ve managed to get a lot of genes to get a lot of genes that would have otherwise been <unk> and made out of the population .
and secondly , we as we have a species , our environment , that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and create , and we mix so much , that you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary , for evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that it will be an evolution of the traditional way , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of the evolution would be <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and as far as the isolation goes , as a species , we cover planets , it will be insulation and the changes of the environment , the evolution of evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , amazing and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that isn &apos;t simple , but led to us as <unk> in the decisions we do .
now how could it happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
well , let &apos;s look at the reality that people are making decisions about their own cultures .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so think , if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the gender of your child , but also the body of genetic adaptations to cure and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or reducing the risk of risk or strokes ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took us 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of something like a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be the reality that there will be 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will be increasingly available to everyone .
one week ago , the national academy of engineering of engineering was the <unk> prize for francis arnold , and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who developed independently of the natural process of evolution in evolution to work faster and to lead to <unk> proteins in a more efficient way , which is <unk> arnold .
a few years ago , the <unk> of the scientist <unk> <unk> was awarded for his research in which he took an adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes to go back to a pluripotent stem cell , to return to a pluripotent stem cell .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can produce human insulin in bacteria that make viruses that are not only protection in front of themselves , but also the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang of <unk> to influenza that have been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a good thing that tobacco comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and the future will be much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change that sperm and <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , to give your children a better chance -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer to reduce risk ?
who don &apos;t want to healthier children ?
and then the analytical technique , the same motor of science that can enable the change to change the changes to prevent disease , could also enable us to adopt <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t we have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you &apos;re going to expand the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we are in a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be converted to <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires maybe 100,000 years , and we can compress it in a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .
these are decisions that have their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful is more friendly ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and at the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make this decisions ?
the good ones in evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another one , the <unk> helps to stand up and go back and walk up .
so at berkeley , we call this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re not other than something that they put in in the morning , and that gives you extra strength , and it gives you extra strength , and it &apos;s going to help you move your velocity and help them , for example .
this is actually the real one of human and machine .
but not only that -- that &apos;s that , and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers , who wears about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the demand that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some significant complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would take a challenge of this challenge and create a <unk> that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or human universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with that <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds of a rough terrain for many hours .
so flexible design allows you to go deep down , crawling deep , highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re as far as we think of this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our look at wheelchair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who have been sitting in a wheelchair in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord spinal cord spinal cord spinal cord injury -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s , was the fate and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population that multiplied themselves .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or the wheelchair is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it has been 500 years since , by the way i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in the field of mobility .
so let me introduce you now to you now , this is carried by amanda <unk> , who suffered a <unk> , which is the result of 19 years ago that they had no longer running over 19 years and far .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
its entirely <unk> sensors in crutches , the signals that are on our <unk> , which is attached to your back .
here are also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips as well as the <unk> that they move forward in this fairly <unk> and very , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , i was <unk> by a <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement on my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor in my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steel every single hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies , i &apos;ve been able to learn to go and learn to climb up , to climb up , and go even with your hands .
but nothing was invented to let me go again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all wheelchair users , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss the <unk> of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i didn &apos;t get the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a volunteer in a volunteer <unk> .
now , in our town , in the volunteers of a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to be able to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers of the <unk> , so i had a really good opportunity .
but it was still a race against the other volunteer to reach the <unk> <unk> and find out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had a very serious conversation with the <unk> that certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the <unk> and she stood in a screen outside of a screen out of the rain , and her house was burned .
the other volunteers who arrived just in front of me -- we call him martin luther -- reached the <unk> first to go to the house and became asked to save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> envy .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who was now able to tell the rest of his life to people that he was going into a <unk> house to save a living living , only because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> .
he said , &quot; yeah , you have to go to the house .
you need to go up to the fire , by the fire , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
now , not exactly what i hoped i had to do , but i went up -- the stairs that go up , the hallway , on the &quot; real &quot; <unk> , which had been pretty finished at that moment , in the bedroom to a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom of my <unk> and loved dog .
we put our resources out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , he got a lot more attention than mine .
a couple of weeks later , the <unk> was given a letter to the <unk> , where she was doing for the brave effort in the rescue of her house .
one of the most <unk> <unk> kindness : somebody actually brought her some shoes .
and so in my profession , as well as the robin hood , as well as a volunteer fireman , i see a witness of generosity and kindness at the big scale , but i also see the love and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i see myself in this room , and i see people who are either going to have been successful or on their way , i &apos;d like to offer this memory , you don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for you to do a difference in the life of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;ll give it now .
do you go into a <unk> , room in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day there will be a chance to save a human life , but every day we offers the opportunity to change one .
so they go off ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where women will lead to the women who have sex with sex &apos; hello , and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious deal .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your blood .
this is the world of <unk> bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our closest living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , one evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well chimps are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin
during the chimpanzees of large , fear <unk> these guys are going to lead the <unk> of <unk> females .
they really came up with this , because this leads to a very <unk> society , in the fatal force of violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known as the primates .
they live in the depths of the <unk> , and they &apos;re only very difficult to get available .
congo is a paradox -- -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the arena of a violent debate that has been <unk> for decades and almost so many lives like the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprised that these destruction also survive at risk .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> is that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules so conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of bonobos is from more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
game is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s an essential for the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play increases in creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , variety of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look at bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
now , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique footage out of the wild .
first of all , a <unk> <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin , &quot; she grabs him with the eggs . &quot;
except i think it &apos;s more , it &apos;s not true .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that makes new elements of the game -- like the testes -- and also how the game is doing both trust -- while it &apos;s a big thing at the time .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of forms that some people are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to find the wonder again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peacefully with water .
i think just like you &apos;re going to play alone , and we &apos;re <unk> boundaries of our inner and outside worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact and interact with the unexpected wiring that we form are the real breeding ground in creativity .
this is just a little <unk> on the insights , the bonobos giving us <unk> in our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to rising challenges , through greater creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to be successful in a <unk> world , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos , the same thing for bonobos , they don &apos;t live in the teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , it may be on the <unk> .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and playing together as we play creativity <unk> and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , the same day , at the same moment , at the same moment , every single baby -- okay .
so , two couples , each <unk> , a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the <unk> , because , if you imagine all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case that &apos;s in a y <unk> in a <unk> , that &apos;s the x chromosome in the <unk> .
and in the other case , this is a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome in the <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two hats .
in a hat , i &apos;m looking at the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- the human body , the animal body -- how they <unk> with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> .
the other hat i used to do with my work is the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as impatients -- of people who are patients who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> social norms in the question .
so for example , i worked with people who are twins twins , two people in your body .
i &apos;ve worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people , their gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll give you just a few examples of the kinds of things that aren &apos;t the male or female standard or female standard .
in one case , you might have somebody with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> the <unk> gene <unk> , the <unk> gene , which we &apos;ve all got up to <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are still giving on testosterone .
but because that individual is missing the receptors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a result , the body evolves more of the typical female course .
when the child &apos;s born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly until they reached puberty and grow their breasts , and they &apos;re developing , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone comes out there , there &apos;s something different .
and they make a few tests and find out that , instead of <unk> and uterus , they &apos;re testicles and uterus , and you have a y .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person for actually a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies something called <unk> .
they are in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> places that are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i am -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> , but i think i &apos;ve probably got the typical typical -- most women like i &apos;m actually talking about <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
and the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more <unk> than a woman who was born with testicles and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across all the bandwidth .
another example : a couple of years ago , i got the phone call at a age of age 19 , which was a boy who was young , he had a friend , had sex with his friend , had sex with his girlfriend , and he had just found that he had <unk> and the uterus .
he had an extreme form of <unk> .
it has <unk> chromosomes , and in the womb , his <unk> were so strong that they &apos;re essentially producing a male <unk> .
and as a result , his <unk> were in the place , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one saw something .
and it was only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he <unk> the doctors that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example for a variant of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , creating something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it was <unk> or twins twins -- surgeons are often adapted to the norm because this is not because of their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often made different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
and typically our system is based on the idea that there is a certain anatomical characteristic with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is meant to be a female identity , which is a black person , called , <unk> , an african anatomy in terms of your story .
so , we have this awful <unk> idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that &apos;s actually something very different for us , it confused us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , which are two people in your body .
where i had experienced most of the excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender have been asked by the <unk> world cup in berlin in berlin .
many journalists went to me with the question : &quot; what test are you going to do that tells us whether <unk> <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists to explain that there was no test .
now , we know that gender complicated enough is that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have to go between male and female , or between male and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , we are the one that <unk> that line , of course .
so we have a situation like that , where , as we continue to accelerate our science , we have to have to say more so that these categories that we thought were built for robust anatomical categories , which made very simple <unk> <unk> to create permanent <unk> .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our <unk> has allowed .
in our observation , we get into all kinds of <unk> areas .
we &apos;re going towards the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we only tell us about a few <unk> ?
as we move our science forward , we come increasingly into a zone of the <unk> , where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the <unk> , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have a tough talk about what point is a body to humans , so he &apos;s pretty much more than fetal life .
we have very hard arguments today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to struggle with the question when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve got somebody to keep a feather under the nose , and if it moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if she didn &apos;t move , you &apos;d bury them .
but today , we are in a situation where we take people &apos;s organs and they want to implant them .
and as a result , we caught ourselves in the fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult position that we have no longer so simple categories .
now you could think that the whole thing of someone would not do with me really happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it &apos;s nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i &apos;m tense .
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking democracy .
so , to tell you about this <unk> , i first have to do a big fan of founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in what they were doing , i &apos;m looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what <unk> has happened with the <unk> .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a <unk> concept , and they were carrying it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years to us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers rejected the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the rulers of the old world had no idea based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion of people who had political power to have that political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather , to the son and so on .
and so the founding fathers go back and replace it through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all humans have been created with the same .
they <unk> the field field and decided that <unk> has seen the commonalities , not the difference , and that was very radical .
now , they made this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up .
if you look at the history of founding fathers , clearly , many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , just like a supernatural concept of power , back to where the transmission of a very <unk> concept is based on a very <unk> concept .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and for example , when you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s nature .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they made us a concept of <unk> commonalities .
and so they have the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , the women , the <unk> <unk> , the concept of founding fathers , which says that there &apos;s nowhere else more important than both the anatomical difference and said , &quot; that we should not have a uterus and <unk> , that we should not have the other citizenship , that we should not have the <unk> , the right , etc .
and women <unk> that successful .
the next successful civil rights movement was the successful civil rights movement , where we were looking at people like <unk> <unk> , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> line of the <unk> , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , human skin color , in addition to there , in addition to both sorts of <unk> professions , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
now , of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the similarities , we have to start asking , why we sustain certain <unk> .
now mind mind , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish at the same rights as a fish .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have been right to sex their informed consent to sex or marry .
so there &apos;s some anatomical <unk> to make sense for me , and that &apos;s what we think should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is , and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that were <unk> at the beginning of the speech .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , in 1979 .
imagine one of them , mary , three months <unk> was born , so she &apos;s born in june 1 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to the <unk> , so he &apos;s born in the last march .
except for the fact that maria three months were born , you &apos;d take all kinds of rights three months from <unk> -- the right to have sex , which is right to choose the right .
they have to wait for all this , not because it actually has a different biological age , only because of the birth of the birth of the birth .
we &apos;re finding other things about what their rights are .
<unk> , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- even though i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s <unk> -- because you accept that he &apos;s a male , he can now move in , where maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , in all states , can &apos;t see the same right thing , the <unk> in all states , who have the right to get married .
<unk> can marry a woman in any state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these sustained categories that are problematic in many ways problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science of progress in the realm of the anatomy is that we have to do a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels sometimes as if science makes its own .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we must pull a line somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas , texas , decided that to get a man to marry a man , you have no y and get married , you know , you have a y .
now in practice , people are not tested for their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a dream .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be human skin , but the character of their character , &quot; judge , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you discover people because of their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure we &apos;re going to give up rights to people , because i have to admit that i know that i know a series of golden <unk> that probably make benefits more than some people i know .
i want to say that i &apos;ve probably seen some bright <unk> , <unk> , more intelligent decisions and more mature decisions for their sexual relationships than some <unk> i know .
so how are we going to ask the question after the character of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me wonder what if the content of a personality would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- through an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make thoughts about questions about democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve made our work properly , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as it &apos;s iran in iran , where a man who sexually drawn to other men is being punished with death , unless he &apos;s ready to put a <unk> in which case he can stay alive .
the states of this species exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon who i talked about a few years ago that had some identical twins who had <unk> twins in order to separate them .
but when i went through him , and he asked why he was doing these interventions -- it was a <unk> operation -- his answer was that the kids would be treated very poorly , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
and i said to him , &quot; well , they &apos;ve been taking political asylum in consideration instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states gives incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are , without having them to change in the state .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about fathers .
and i want to think about what democracy might look like , or looked at that if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something that is a feminist thing for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are <unk> by different kinds of anatomy , when people are applying a <unk> use .
for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the realm of <unk> .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not every one , but in average , complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable is a lot of attention .
and therefore , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i met a graduate student , one of my <unk> who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked as a feminist , so i thought , a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about to resolve stereotypes about gender , so that feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there could be something <unk> in feminism .
this is supposed to say that there might be something , on average , which made women brains of male different brains of what makes us <unk> social relationships for social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding fathers were extremely <unk> to figure out how individuals could protect the state in front of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we <unk> more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re going to be able to change it , not just how to preserve , but how we care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s what we need to go into the future when we have to go to democracy about anatomy -- less to think less about the individual bodies of identity and more about relationships .
so that when we try to try to create a human connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do , i &apos;m going to do a very public confession , and this is , i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it to every opportunity to find a different <unk> , <unk> outfit , wear <unk> , and to photograph the last time and blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of second hand in <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and also my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people , my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look quite unique , and it &apos;s going to buy it to my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
will it have my size ?
will i like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers may be , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve raised for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven of <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly a week are everything i did in my suitcase .
i have bet that i was going to have anything i wanted to wear , if i first came up to palm springs .
and since she &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who walk here at ted &apos;s underwear -- which is , i found a few things .
and i really want to show you my <unk> for this week .
that sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons i &apos;m going to leave you , whether you believe or not , from these <unk> , to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the shining tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , had 55 to me , and it was the most expensive thing i carried in this entire week .
monday : color is a little <unk> .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re pulling other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation totally <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life trying to try and be myself and adapt at the same time .
be just who you are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you don &apos;t just understand it , they &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i looked like i &apos;m playing &apos; dress , or i remember her .
i like smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not good at something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me a day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that just for you .
if you believe that you are a wonderful person in the inside , there &apos;s nothing you can do .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anybody here in this audience .
we should be able to do everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit into everything .
and ultimately , saturday : a saturday , unique style , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me , and over this week people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate all of that again .
because the lesson i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t need to be emotionally <unk> , because the corner is always going to be another kind of crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just wait for me , if i have a little love in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy grows in italy with this picture in the room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is something that &apos;s done something very interesting in the past decades .
a few time ago , if you wanted to win a formula a race , they took their budget and put her money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , today , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this -- something like this -- something that has a car in real time , some thousands of sensors , the information that &apos;s going on from the car , that it &apos;s going to take information from the car , and then use it , and then use it to change the car in real time as information in real time .
this would call you , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made of two parts -- a part of a part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> will begin to appear in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start to react in other ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
if we <unk> cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
and by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s earth , but 50 percent of the global population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something about cities , this is a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this perceive and driving in the objects of the everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli , at moma &apos;s year later in the year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , start talking to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this radically changed the interaction that we have out of human beings with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he took him on the end of his hammer , and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can still see a little spot <unk> , and why don &apos;t you talking ? &quot;
well today , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m going to show you just some examples -- again , to embrace our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it was a half and a half years ago .
and what we did , actually , was actually a new kind of network that has been deployed around the world -- this is a <unk> -- and using <unk> and <unk> information from this network to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was a <unk> in italy .
some of you will remember , it was played as italy against france , and then at the end , the <unk> .
and anyway , in italy at the end of the end .
now , look at what happened on this day , just looking at the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
this is the afternoon , people here and there who are making calls and move .
the game starts to -- silence .
france makes a gateway . in italy , there &apos;s a gateway .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second <unk> . end of the normal <unk> .
first extension , second .
<unk> , at a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , at that night , everyone went to celebrate .
they saw the great key cause .
the next day , everyone went to the center for the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everyone went down .
you see the picture of the location , <unk> <unk> , where , since the roman time , the people who celebrate people are -- to have a big party , and you see the key cause at the end of the day .
now , that &apos;s just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we didn &apos;t have a few years ago .
very quickly , another example of feel : this is not about people , but things that we use and consume .
well today we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we know just a little bit about where things go .
so , in this project , we &apos;ve designed some small markers to pursue the waste as it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who have helped us , something more than a year , in seattle , have helped to mark the things that they can see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away .
and then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the trash and started tracking it .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got .
of seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that &apos;s the cup that we throw away not simply , that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we show that people , then we can drive behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could you see much more about that , and the many other wonderful things you can do with perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part , which we discussed in the beginning , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> who came to us , and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition in the public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
and one of the ideas that had been <unk> in a <unk> , imagine these tubes , and valves , <unk> , valves , open and close .
they do something like a <unk> of water .
when they fall off , they can write on it , they can write patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to make them <unk> , as you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor <unk> .
it really liked him .
and we got the mission to design a building at the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and make it in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and become the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that day , if you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they have destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they haven &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside the inside .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
well , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors happened when all the sensors happened .
but actually it was even more fun in that night .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them , but a building that still breaks breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump right now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , really exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how the people are using things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with the people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections .
and this is what makes us think about this project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine these <unk> could really start flying .
imagine if you could have little helicopter , they could fly through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> light with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you &apos;ve seen earlier , who is moving with others , totally in sync .
you can have this cloud .
they can have a kind of <unk> screen or ad , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but in three dimensions , where what changes , what changes , is not the position of <unk> .
they can play with different types .
imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then this whole could just be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can walk , and through which you can move through that you can look at a lot of different directions .
here you can see a real <unk> , the <unk> in order to form a <unk> v .
when you turn on the light , it looks like this . so just as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people has been controlled .
it could have any individual <unk> on a impulse that comes from people , from the motions of people or so forth .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- <unk> at the metropolitan theater at the metropolitan theater , and the <unk> in milan -- we took its movements in 3d to use it as a momentum for <unk> .
you can see <unk> dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the <unk> , they can play with it and play with color movement .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics for the olympics .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
again , the idea is , imagine that again , we put people together to do something and change the environment -- almost as something we call to make <unk> insert a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that anyone can give a little donation for a <unk> .
i think the remarkable thing about what happened last years , the last decades is that we are changing from a physical world to a digital world .
and this has digitized everything , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible to the internet .
so today , for the first time , we can do this for the first time -- and the obama obama obama showed this -- we can change from the digital world from the <unk> forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow it can , to ask us the coming challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical world .
so the idea is that we actually put people in the people in which they do things together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud of <unk> , in the same way that a cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical thing in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually share it from the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 , and more than the connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something that you can go to the very top is like london new <unk> .
you can get inside .
and some kind of digital <unk> at night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , it &apos;s very important to me .
through my work , i try to express that people aren &apos;t separate from nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica about 10 years ago , where i first saw my first <unk> .
let me go .
my heart hit me , i was <unk> while i was trying to grab what was in front of me .
the <unk> around me <unk> about 60 meters of water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snowflake , year after year .
<unk> are born as calf of a glacier or by breaking out of <unk> .
each iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact in distinct ways with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and they &apos;re <unk> to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t withstand it and make more dramatic passion .
when you look at a iceberg , you just think that they &apos;re isolated , separate and alone , as we humans often see us .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a iceberg melts , i &apos;m going to <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg melt , it &apos;s free drinking water that feeds a lot of <unk> .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of this <unk> , as i was going to make portraits of my ancestors in consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments , and we &apos;re never going to exist .
it &apos;s not death when it melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but a <unk> of your <unk> along the life cycle .
one part of the ice in the middle of the ice that i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and one part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i &apos;d like to show you the last pictures that i &apos;d like to show you , a iceberg that i put in greenland in greenland .
so , very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a <unk> iceberg .
so here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , he starts roll , and the boat is moving to the other side , the man &apos;s there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , it shows you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is truly blessed by doing some amazing projects .
but in the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it &apos;s about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then one day he came back from running and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of that .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i said to him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire and pay attention .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , it &apos;s not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t be any paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about the higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterfly and <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- they &apos;re running along the way .
i said , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need , just a check , and instead , i put a check that i didn &apos;t know the <unk> idea how i was supposed to <unk> him .
i kept putting myself in place and his brother and his father -- &quot; well , my proposal is like this : &quot; well , my suggestion here is this : he &apos;ll talk to him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to get it back to his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who doesn &apos;t carry all that in itself , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface , and then drawing a light on each surface , which is just registered the negative area .
so they pull around and make <unk> like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the back of the organs , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and then finally , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife &apos;s dinner , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to control things , and then we should find a way to drive things that would be great .
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
first of all , we have the insurance companies on the doors , and they actually get a device that he can communicate with -- an stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really funny -- i call it <unk> , because you &apos;re talking to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers around the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i pulled into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were nice to do that , and that we were <unk> and all the pictures on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we were programming , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved in my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we &apos;ve bought in the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , you have <unk> , they set up on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code for free , the software can be able to download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
no hospital .
every paralyzed , every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now there &apos;s all this <unk> before the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony <unk> , tony <unk> .
and that &apos;s an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s seeing his life support system .
we tended his bed to see outside .
we set up a projector against a wall of the <unk> hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling was in the parking lot .
we also had to deal with <unk> in the parking lot , so we felt a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he would send us an email with following the content , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something about seven years .
i feel like i was pushing under water , and i finally got up and put my head up and down my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that holds us on the shelf and keeps us developing .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> right .
and somebody who has such a <unk> potential , it deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re in figuring out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it &apos;s all coming from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us , and then , in december , the <unk> is honored by one of the 50 best innovations in 2010 , which was really neat .
the <unk> of it is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that there &apos;s this april of april , <unk> <unk> in the inner city of los angeles in the city of los angeles that will be an exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there may be quite the hardest representative of the <unk> there -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m about to do something that &apos;s impossible , then it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had something to do with <unk> , but i just captured something , and i &apos;ve just been surrounded by the amazing people so that we could put together something on the legs .
and this question should each one of you should ask , and every single day you have a little noticed that you have to get done . if not now , when ? and if i don &apos;t know who then ?
thank you .
so i write for children , and it &apos;s probably america &apos;s most <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer or in leather , but no one has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s a enlightenment for usually something that you find because you left it somewhere .
you go around the block , and it was a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle started back in the &apos; 60s in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the <unk> .
they did <unk> .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had an thumb , i had 85 dollars , and i proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it in the &apos; 80s when i found a work on <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call from this teacher , wife post , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
can you come to ohio to ohio , and please come together with the guy i know that they &apos;ve been found .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to be a hurry . &quot;
well the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew you &apos;d have to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we took us to them , and we gave them up to her family , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted me to learn as an adult who got to learn me , she turned into a box full of ashes and was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of which i was talking about .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she has saved my life , and my partner and i rescued her .
and you know , this part of life takes everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned today .
he needs the same thing -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you walked up at 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full smoke .
imagine an engine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
that sounds <unk> .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at her in the same way , and they said , &quot; no problem , we might have caught a couple of birds . &quot;
the pilot had a <unk> machine , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later happened three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it goes on the <unk> .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> on the ground . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the <unk> .
i was able to see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to pass a hand , and it wasn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experiences that i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did .
and as i was thinking about it later , i noticed one saying , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is far , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to change anything in life .
and this urgency , that goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> the george washington bridge that &apos;s pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and my mistakes , i <unk> , to become better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego room .
and i &apos;m looking at the time that i wasted for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , too .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have a lot more with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to be right , i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the inner clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ...
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts as you know of a documentary .
as we <unk> <unk> , i had this feeling , man , to die , is not terrifying .
it &apos;s almost like we were preparing for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really is really in one thought , which is that i just want to just one thing .
i just wish i could grow up with my children .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
it &apos;s not yet .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
i realized that at the time , by putting the dots together , it was just about being a great father .
more than everything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i found the wonders that day don &apos;t die on this day .
i received another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live in differently .
my call to everybody who flies today is : do you think the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would they do that they do it , because you think they &apos;re always there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes that you see here is <unk> .
now , if we can do the systems that control <unk> and valves , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not working with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can create an effective <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> , to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will run into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started doing our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the meaning and purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the <unk> part , the <unk> part , made of <unk> <unk> failures .
and it seemed like something <unk> with these gray boxes , that <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment with <unk> , and we studied this building .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> a little bit like a <unk> that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> on it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my mind .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i was going to go to a <unk> attack .
fully pointed at a particular target .
the <unk> <unk> active <unk> on the gray box around , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program that you can get infected is the goal .
and if you don &apos;t , don &apos;t do anything .
so this really got my interest , and we started working with this , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the destination is .
so <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> code , and found that it &apos;s <unk> in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional designed , of people who had all of the <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that they had to attack .
they probably had the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve noticed that the <unk> of <unk> complex is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
so here you can see a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks quite like old-fashioned <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking for as first was <unk> <unk> , because we know what this does .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring this to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or disprove .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , and it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s really likely to be in iran because there were most of the infections .
well in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s essentially going out on the <unk> nuclear power , and it &apos;s in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for <unk> and power plants . &quot;
and i called them , and i called them , and you know , to compare their expertise to compare what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor there is this moving part of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this brain , then you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor there , and even eventually to make the centrifuge explode .
and what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually slow to happen , slowly , to let it happen , obviously , to make <unk> despair , so you can &apos;t be able to get it quickly behind it .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of how we looked very closely and <unk> .
so , for example , the number <unk> is very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started with scientific literature on how these <unk> were built in <unk> , and found that they were <unk> in so-called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it adapted .
and it became better .
these <unk> in iran are divided into 15 so-called <unk> levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us a lot of confidence that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s not easy .
these results were done by several weeks of hard work .
and we just ran into a dead end , and we had to get <unk> .
anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads are actually on a and the same goal , but from different directions .
so the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and down it , and the big <unk> comes up with six <unk> into interaction and manipulating them .
so , in the big , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;re actually determined by what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be made by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- was really out of the socks .
it &apos;s the gray box , and on top of it , you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s <unk> values from sensors -- like , for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s available , and it &apos;s available to the <unk> code , which is still with the <unk> data .
and in fact , this false <unk> data has been taken by <unk> .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where , while the <unk> are fed with <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea here is not just that <unk> <unk> in the control room .
in fact , there &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , for example , in a power station , for example , if you &apos;re going to be fast , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and if they &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and it &apos;s not the <unk> , but the <unk> will notice .
this is scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker &apos;s -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> stick on a <unk> stick , as we &apos;ve seen it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the most sophisticated environments .
we need to put the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better preparing for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported a lot of it that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s been involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the <unk> superpower .
there are only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you that you have a <unk> <unk> . thank ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years trying to place myself in situations which are usually very difficult and at the same time .
i went to prison -- hard .
i &apos;ve been working on a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing to eat here -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the greatest part of my career at seem to <unk> situations , and all of that for trying to study social activity in the way that it is <unk> and interesting , and hopefully in a way to understand what it makes in the audience to enjoy the audience .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here , i would come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i &apos;d do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of this , i &apos;ve heard a couple of weeks ago in ebay .
and i would send out some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk in 2011 .
really , some of the happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , the unique opportunity to get -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it happen -- the <unk> of the talk , you see the <unk> of the talk .
so what you &apos;ve got was this : this is her name : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and who you &apos;ll end up with the ears for the ears , especially if i took your company stupid .
but besides , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so , despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone into some pretty awful situations over the years , but nothing could prepare for me , and nothing was able to do anything so difficult and to go to this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea of a movie .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything , from up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , completely with brands , which you &apos;ll see in the film , which is the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people will be connected in eternity -- forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more on the emphasis .
it was &quot; last , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand as a <unk> , but we &apos;ll make sure we &apos;re going to sell any possible category .
so we might sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever had , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually , to get them to finance the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to do that if <unk> would help you happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop this ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it will be hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth the value , some really familiar brands .
you know , who knows when the movie comes out , we might see like a <unk> .
what do you believe in the answer ?
the answer is most likely to be <unk> .
but is it a tough thing about the film or a difficult thing to me ?
jk : both .
... so means not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about the brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people who you have to do .
there are some places we can turn to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera that would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out that it meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
none wanted to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to present your product as many people as possible as possible as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection , of new and old media and the media media media media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting way , that the masses brings that message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re in transparency , you see it &apos;s -- this is one of the first images that seems to appear .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> , and immediately understand ; characterized by <unk> and the access to information , especially , which is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but as far as it is , it &apos;s supposed to be implemented .
but why ? well , transparency is terrified -- like this strange bear , the still <unk> bear .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and she &apos;s also very risky .
what else is still risky ?
a whole bowl of <unk> food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , my father caught me on lying -- and there he sits and look at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of the story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there was only one company , an authority to help us -- and it &apos;s also because i know john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , and i found that i had to do it with my team to the companies .
so what you suddenly started understanding -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start to talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i &apos;ve got friends who do big , giant <unk> , and i have friends who do little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , say that the reason why your movies are so successful is that they have so successful that they have .
and then my friends say that little <unk> are doing , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how are we going to see ban you in the movie ?
whenever i open up on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see you you &apos;re going to see <unk> .
and every time i put somebody out , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe they should be a little bit about the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped both for men as well as women -- solid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can all answer their questions and give you an unprecedented version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re a <unk> brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so to make these things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe a ban ?
you &apos;re <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you describe something that someone &apos;s supposed to describe .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this particular thing really makes too a positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , <unk> three .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the guy in the street , like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love beautiful clothing .
&apos; 80s , &apos; 80s hits <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the way i have , is probably &quot; glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and such stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry , and this stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes <unk> .
man 2 : the brand that i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : partly hippie , i &apos;m part of <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> across the country in the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often look at the intersection of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could go into my head , someone who really could really help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company named olson <unk> in <unk> .
they &apos;ve helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> helped to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it , you could also help me .
you brought their pictures with , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how that is with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who shapes my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world that you live in -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so .
all of these things come and start from a place , and for me , they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is this thinking and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like a strange thing .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do you do ?
what is the <unk> ? what <unk> are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , that &apos;s not you .
what else do they go through ?
that &apos;s not a fear . what kind of rollercoaster is you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much .
yeah . all right .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> had two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost an oxymoron .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re not safe to be afraid of avoiding these elements , and they turn them to , and they turn them to themselves , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what else brands do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , wii mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s some kinds of brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> brand is a pretty strong brand .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if someone asked them to describe their <unk> , your <unk> , how would you ?
you &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that makes blood in <unk> ?
or are you more likely to be a <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh such as <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , magical , magical and <unk> , magic and <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionately , on oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , safe , <unk> , <unk> , way about the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , the up and <unk> , and the &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted to do nothing with this film , because they didn &apos;t control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 <unk> who were willing to get out on this control that was going to do with somebody who &apos;s going to do with somebody and make us feel <unk> to tell stories that we normally don &apos;t have to tell -- stories that usually would never be supported .
they &apos;re <unk> to tell us the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using these days to <unk> the <unk> of the brain , both for advertising as well .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> is banned .
in the entire city , for five years , not <unk> , no poster , no poster , nothing .
and we went to school districts where companies companies themselves their way in impoverished schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got to get the most feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i do with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands do .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and do something completely different , something that people will think of that is that the world challenges our view .
and what was that for you ? what it succeeded ?
well , if the film was going festival , we can look at this time .
according to <unk> , the first time in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> from this film .
it &apos;s actually just a period of two a / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been <unk> yet .
it &apos;s not even online , no <unk> .
he &apos;s not come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every <unk> we talked about , who we talked about their clients to make the fingers of it .
something that i believe is that if you take a chance to arrest your chance , risks that are in these risks .
i think if you get people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that when you train your employees to avoid risk , you prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we have to encourage people to have no fear of what you might have .
finally , in progress , we should welcome fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
you welcome fear . are you going to welcome the risk .
a lot of a <unk> spoon , so we &apos;re called the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of honesty .
and that &apos;s what i said , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; i mean transparency , &quot; you &apos;ve been showing you from my good friends of <unk> , which <unk> on ebay for ebay .
big data will transform for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
<unk> presents : &quot; hot transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency this : what &apos;s happening to the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , displayed on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check from high dollars from <unk> to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m <unk> to do something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is today , gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great training in britain -- i didn &apos;t get myself -- but i had no access to museums , and this artwork can &apos;t access .
and when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried this desire to make art more accessible -- with technology .
and then we trained a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and you &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look around in all these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , van gogh .
i &apos;m in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around , and you go around .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open up the map , and jump it up with a click .
in there they are , they want to go up until the end of the gangs .
just further . much fun .
look around .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so , i &apos;m in front of my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> at the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum has given us the picture , click on it .
this is now one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click here -- but i click it now .
this is one of the images that we were stuck with the so-called <unk> .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
now i &apos;m going to show you .
you can very light in and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , this sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to get close , and they realized slowly , that kids actually beat something .
i &apos;ve been doing a little research on the met with some famous at met , and i actually found that it was a game called <unk> , where a goose hit a stick with a stick .
it seemed to be quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
in order to get close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you <unk> , i get out to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump up at moma at moma , and again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
and the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see van gogh the masterpiece of that masterpiece ?
you go in . you can really go in there .
i &apos;m going to zoom in with one of my favorite pieces of the picture until i really am in the cracks .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
every one of them , everybody -- whether it &apos;s rich or poor if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
they can go ahead and create their own museum online -- from all these pictures , you can put your own collection .
just simply , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can tag all of these things , you can put on your friends , and make a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , i think , the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming here .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility .
i mean , i hope that we will just represent this digital medium of art , and they represent <unk> online .
and this is the biggest question that i asked recently : &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s about it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be <unk> in half .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of each hemisphere , we could pose your brain .
for example , this is somebody that &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high <unk> that &apos;s at the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so forth .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so , as one of the individuals , i see myself as one of the people , in common with most of the <unk> that need a good percentage of logic , to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to do experiments in fact .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and look at how it responds , and then we start developing our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably a thing at the same time just to be in a place .
i mean , it can sound odd to think that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember seeing a child playing on a <unk> .
he was still a toddler , and it was not very good at it , and it constantly fell .
but i bet he &apos;s teaching him to play a very valuable lesson , which is that big things don &apos;t just leave you over , and they stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so you don &apos;t have a <unk> .
it would be a horrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little weird particles .
and when they play with their particles , put all kinds of weird things -- how you fly directly through walls , or you can be in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe them all the mundane objects around us .
that has not liked my intuition , and maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t often play a particle .
well , i play sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it .
because if all of these things are out of particles , and all these particles are following the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why this should not be that .
so i &apos;d better feel better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made myself a few years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see , which was in <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle there .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s a picture of the object .
and i &apos;ll zoom in here . we &apos;re looking right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a springboard and it stands over the edge of it .
so i did this thing in a way that makes a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool hole and getting this thing .
but this thing has the ability to be in <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it &apos;s to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m alone , i &apos;m doing all kinds of weird things , but then i &apos;m going to go to other people , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to bother it to be , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are equally comfortable with .
it &apos;s not just people <unk> objects , it &apos;s not only people , but also the light that seems to them , and the wind , which is by you and the wind of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is <unk> , we had to <unk> all the <unk> out .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned the light off , put it in a vacuum , and they put it out into a vacuum , and it <unk> it down to almost now , on the elevator , the piece of metal in the elevator was free to act as it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
and what we found was that it &apos;s really strange .
instead , it &apos;s just going there , it &apos;s <unk> it , and the way it was <unk> was something like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could vibrate it up at the same time and not vibrate -- something which is only allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to vibrate and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> atoms out of the metal are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms move on and down .
just too precise <unk> agrees .
the rest of the time are they <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is in two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal is metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth taking me for all this year into the clean space , because , you know , that &apos;s the <unk> between a single atom and that piece metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom at the same time can be two different places , this piece of metal in two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would you deal with your mind that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal is always in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it looks like all the objects in the elevator , is actually just <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected .
now , that &apos;s not really right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s like these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of the quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> , like we think about economic development .
it should be our goal , that when families want to think about where they want to live and work , you want to pick up the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new residents .
right now , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to say that it would be welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it &apos;s so much more value than it costs them to build .
so we could be very simple in the world with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now it may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought of new cities .
but they &apos;re just going to share it from apartments against cities .
imagine that , half of the people who want to live in apartments , they would do this ; the other half but not .
they could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you were going to do , in these apartments , and their environment , rule to be able to avoid complaints from <unk> .
so it turns out to be very hard to get out of all these extensions .
but you could go to a whole new place , and build a completely new space block that , as the laws there were going to support one such and support it .
so i proposed that governments are creating new surfaces that have enough space for a city and give them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of reform , honduras .
they knew that every year , over 75,000 <unk> had left their country to <unk> in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do , to ensure that these people can stay in their country , and do the same in honduras .
at this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we just take a <unk> area of our country &apos;s land , if we just take them a message to the american embassy , a part of the canadian <unk> , and if people want to work under the canadian rules , or the united states , can you have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , honduras suffered from a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> has been a turnaround in a shift whose program , as well as <unk> promised .
he challenged <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared myself to talk to tedglobal .
through improvement , try and the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city on the essence of the world .
the first point is the importance of laws , the laws that determine that you &apos;re not allowed to disturb existing problems .
we pay for new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and they are usually the laws that help us back .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and that again showed him <unk> .
the two were called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotel in miami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable you are than they cost them .
and i used this graph to show you how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , thinking that a area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars a square meter of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a place when there was a pause , said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form is that a <unk> city is a place that is the beginning of <unk> land , a <unk> , which defines the laws that have been there , and the people have the opportunity to have to live under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who said that we need to do this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and i was asked to keep a talk on the fourth and fifth january .
so i &apos;ve given another kind of facts <unk> talk , which has a chart like this one , trying to make sure that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in <unk> .
by that airport alone , it has a surface of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of it if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite , all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and alert .
the head of congress came up on the stage , and i said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line , that a new city gives people new opportunities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders .
and the leaders of government , in honduras , would be on the aid of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , which they could do to do with this charter , and can help support that anyone can trust that the charter is actually taken off .
and the realization of president <unk> was that the <unk> that i thought about as a way to get the foreign investors to get here , and to build this city , for all parties , in honduras , for many years of fear and mistrust .
we went into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it <unk> a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , on january of january , you &apos;ve voted congress for a change in the constitution , to have a <unk> control that is for special <unk> .
in a country that has just been a tremendous crisis in which congress was elected to a voice for these <unk> .
all parties , all the parties of society , supported this .
in order to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on the 17th february of february 17th , it &apos;s been approved to a voice .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st and february of february , there was an delegation of about 30 places of the world who were most interested in the world who were most interested in the business of <unk> .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new core center , which built in south korea , in south korea , <unk> large than the city center .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
there were already two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about this , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> , and they consider this area to the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a law to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
one country has already offered his supreme court offered to be available as trial for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even get any funding .
one of the things you already know , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are lots of businesses that like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all over the world , there are 700 million people to say that they would like to live in a different place .
one million people left every year every year , and go to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to make their work , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to earn enough money to make themselves food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes the kids who are trying to find their parents , they have no longer seen in some cases in some cases in a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in honduras for a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or to build hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you do on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices , which is a typical american day in a day , is <unk> <unk> .
also , recently , a study of ceos was doing the ceos who watched a week .
and these scientists just documented the different themes with each other , and they &apos;ve been engaged with the ceo , and how much time they spent decisions about doing these issues .
and they &apos;ve found that an average ceo of the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these themes were , of course , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed it an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of category to the one an hour ?
how good do you think you &apos;re at dealing with the decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to give you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise up because i &apos;m blind , just your hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , you know , my first question for today is , are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> store , at least it was really exclusive .
it was a store , the <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had to have been <unk> .
i loved going to this business , but at a time i asked myself , you know , how do you never do something ?
here &apos;s the olive gear .
they had had 75 different kinds of oil olive oil , including those who were locked into boxes that came from a thousand years old <unk> .
so i decided to visit one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model , that you really do all of these opportunities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists which came every day , and they usually had their cameras .
and so we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve set up a little video camera directly at the entrance .
we &apos;ve put six different flavors of flavors or 24 different flavors of <unk> , and we &apos;ve been looking at two things : first , i &apos;m going to look at two things : first , i &apos;m going to have more people to stand and try ?
there are more people alive if it was 24 percent , about 60 percent than if it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were doing rather a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the opposite effect .
the people who stayed when it was 24 , bought only three percent in fact .
from the people who stayed when they were six , well now we saw 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
well , if you do it , the people bought six times more of a glass that they had six times when they had 24 / 7 .
now , you don &apos;t choose to buy a glass of a glass of <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> are also influenced us with very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even when it comes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial crisis .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i was doing with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in which we were watching the decisions for retirement by almost a million americans in the entire united states of america .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> that were possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a <unk> plan , the likelihood that would be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had something about <unk> plans that offered something between two to 59 different fund fund .
and what we found was that the more fund we &apos;ve been offered that , in fact , that was lower rate .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans to give the plans to two fund had a <unk> in the &apos; 70s -- still not as much as we want .
in the plans of almost 60 fund , the <unk> fell on about the <unk> .
now it turns out that if they were to participate in the process , if you have more choices to choices , even it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather , that the more possibilities they were available , the more avoiding it and fund it .
the more choices they were available , the more they were more likely to put their entire money into pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , you know , belongs to the decisions that people recommend when you care about their future financial well-being .
well , over the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three really negative consequences in humans that have to provide more and more choice .
they move the decision -- push , even when it comes against their own best .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial decisions and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to make things that they feel less happy , even if you make it objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may be enjoying this huge shelves of <unk> , mustard and <unk> and <unk> , but we actually don &apos;t have the comparison to compare and boundaries , and actually make some of the fantastic supply .
so what i &apos;d like to show you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in different ways and in different kinds of trials -- which you can just use in your business .
first of all , narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today that &apos;s less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
but in fact , we see it more and more , more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to narrow down , and the <unk> will get rid of the possibilities , now , there &apos;s a increase in sales , and it &apos;s down to the cost of the cost , and there &apos;s a more improvement improvement .
as a <unk> and gamble of the various head and gamble of the different head and <unk> species from 26 to 15 , they would have to cut up 10 percent increase .
when the golden <unk> corporation sold their 10 at the worst , they would have experienced the profits from 87 percent -- a result of the two , the rise of the rise of sales and reducing costs .
you know , the average <unk> today offers 45,000 products .
a typical walmart offers 100,000 products today .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is the <unk> supermarket in the world today , and they give you just 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples that recently come to market about how to get the choice of choice was something that david <unk> has very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees now takes automatically on a <unk> part .
the ones who really want to meet a choice will be offered to 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to narrow it .
they &apos;re all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing that i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different .
and if their employees can &apos;t be <unk> , they can &apos;t do it . &quot;
now before we had lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience to be the most beautiful road on the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read to you that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to embrace gary &apos;s &apos;s .
okay . everybody who &apos;s willing to take gary &apos;s &apos;s service .
are that all ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s objective , looking at the first time more information than the second time , but i would guess that they felt it in the second time in the second time .
because the pictures made it real for them .
so what i &apos;m going to do to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of <unk> is the <unk> .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , which have to understand , which are the consequences of the individual possibilities , and that have to felt the consequences of vivid and concrete .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent of average , if you use a <unk> or a card card , than in cash ?
because it &apos;s not what we &apos;re really going to feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it feel concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so in a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people at <unk> -- employees that were all working for <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed their participation in their <unk> .
and during this gathering , we &apos;ve got this gathering just as they were always , only we added one more little .
the little thing that we &apos;ve got to do with that was that we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in part by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save , or an increase in four percent of the amount , which they were willing to pay for <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can better deal with more categories than a choice .
for example , here &apos;s a study that we made in a <unk> .
it turns out that in the <unk> up and down in the northeast area , the number between <unk> different types of magazines have to <unk> up to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
if i give you 600 magazines and you &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and those in 20 categories , you believe that i gave you more choice and a better <unk> , if i gave them the 600 to 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> , and the ad on jazz is , you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and that , on the right side , is <unk> , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the ones on the left is jazz and the ones on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a profoundly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something that is not providing the choice .
and this problem often , if you look at the long list of all this fund .
who do you want to inform ?
my fourth technique : premise of complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to slowly increase the complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , who gives you the opportunity to give her a car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to create their car completely .
now , these decisions differ in the number of choices that make them choice .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i do now is , i change the sequence of decisions .
half the clients are going to go from many possibilities , 56 <unk> are at the small possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the clients are going on from the small possibilities , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interests you .
if you keep using the <unk> of the decision , that means that you &apos;re overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what you &apos;re finding is that the people who go from many to the low <unk> over and over again , they choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
let &apos;s go from the little choices to the many , then you stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is changing the order in which this information is going to show .
when i start with the very simple , i learn how i &apos;m <unk> .
even though the gear you choose to do , nothing about my preferences , on my preferences , is always trying to pick it to it .
it also gets me excited about the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m willing to be willing to allow me to do with interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that <unk> the problem of <unk> -- narrow -- they &apos;re going to go to the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- they make it real ; we can do better with more categories ; we can prepare better .
each of these techniques that i describe to you today is to help you manage the opportunity -- good for them , you can use them for yourself , good for the people they offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in choice .
and the more we choose to pick and pick , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then that &apos;s why it &apos;s really important .
we all want stars -- <unk> , singer , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so infinitely difficult .
but <unk> is allowing us to all of us , or all our creative activities , we can become a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous by the internet to the next saturday .
but with youtube , more than 48 hours , a minute uploaded .
again , only a tiny percentage ever will ever be <unk> , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times , and just to the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , then we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he filmed his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , there were 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video had been popular by the first summer .
in fact , <unk> didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because what you do is , if you do it , if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> mountain .
he uploaded a lot of <unk> .
and this video was actually already being sent in the january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
they got jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video at the end is so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> presents us new and interesting things and show us a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> get down on your <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year .
there was almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> &quot; seems to be out of nothing .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday that was true .
if you want to know , these other tips are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> on , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson nelson , from the <unk> science theater , was one of the first ones to make a joke about it .
the important thing is that an individual or a group of <unk> took up a view of a big audience , and <unk> the process .
and then this community formed by people who shared this big <unk> , and started talking about it and playing with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> from &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there were a spoof for every single day of day .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the part of the community is to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s just , very simple .
this year , there was almost 50 million times .
and if you think that was crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> of the four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats , looking at this video .
it &apos;s important , creativity , which is in <unk> and <unk> .
there were remixes along .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the ground , which made it from a stupid joke that we all participate in .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something , we do .
who would have all the anticipate ?
who would have predicted &quot; double <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what <unk> would you write in which <unk> ?
in a world where every minute two days of video , can only be uploaded , unique and unexpected <unk> like i mentioned .
i &apos;m going to admit , i wasn &apos;t very interested when i said a friend , i &apos;d like to look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i didn &apos;t have a ticket on the <unk> , but often there are disability that don &apos;t let you drive on the <unk> .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , casey <unk> became funny , and his argument became five million times .
this approach is true for everything we &apos;re creative .
and all of this leads to one big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , is the properties of a new kind of media and culture that everyone has access to , and the audience is determined .
as i said , one of the currently <unk> -- justin bieber was made with youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
and today we feel all today as a owners of culture .
and these are not the characteristics of ancient media , and they don &apos;t even meet the media today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i sit over three minutes about the connectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness is <unk> , when she was sitting over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and four nights ago , she was stuck in a small boat in the chinese sea .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s burning his work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of oneness and freedom was held together .
if you think about it at the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , as he must say that his life has been a big waste .
the words , as long as his friends , are <unk> .
he moved to silence .
he died , broke by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was not trying to <unk> us , but it &apos;s gone .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> <unk> <unk> .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for her , life had been asked her a task : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
after a four year-olds and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat on the lake as a <unk> .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
they had the greatest fear of pirates , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> .
in a <unk> , my sister was only my sister and i , you know , and my grandmother was drinking .
my first memories are from that boat -- there &apos;s the continuous <unk> of the engine , the middle of any wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came up with a lot of times , but by the <unk> of the men on our boat deceive , or on the <unk> of the engine , the six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights in front of the coast of the coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first one of men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted again .
after three months in refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next one is four women in three generations who are together building a new life .
we let us go down in <unk> , one of the working <unk> <unk> , whose population is made out of <unk> .
unlike it in the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smell of <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> were shared between people who had one thing in common : they started <unk> .
my mother worked on farms , then on an assembly line in a <unk> , six days , <unk> layers .
and they managed to have a way of finding english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given and was put in other education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do , and mostly the new stuff that came out of the second .
two couple of <unk> for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
one <unk> up to the <unk> , because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and there &apos;s <unk> : &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
after home where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other and heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mom suffered from the boat from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night , until their <unk> came up so i could get it .
she opened up a <unk> , and then he got a <unk> and then opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> , angry , <unk> , and <unk> children , caught between two worlds .
loans and donors were looking for .
centers built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the <unk> demands of itself .
in the others , i &apos;ve been involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the isolation .
but that &apos;s how many got to help .
and because of this aid , i became a young <unk> of the year &apos;s young <unk> of the year .
and i was going to go from a <unk> to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , was now tan le , refugee le , refugee and social activist who had never heard of the talks of places that she had never heard of , and in homes , whose existence never could have imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back in routine , and the comfort of the life of an unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who were <unk> every of their days and <unk> each other by the stories of their day and <unk> , we still told the stories of their day .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as they were when we climbed the boat .
no one has been an opportunity .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and not be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and training , and the neglect of <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated from , i realized that i couldn &apos;t go with a career in law school .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , <unk> in the picture -- and not just all right , but something that you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of <unk> .
because <unk> can lead to the collapse of the horizons , so easily , that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
now , i &apos;ve gone enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as you do it .
the possibilities that haven &apos;t been allowed to have been explicitly encouraging .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and <unk> .
so i followed my feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not a <unk> challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a cent a year .
at the end of one morning , i was cooking a huge pot of soup that we shared .
we worked late in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few brilliant , and we managed to get the breakthrough .
i made the decision to draw in the united states .
after just a journey there .
my feeling again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the local speaker was the most important person .
the life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved alone .
by 17 , she had been the second woman to her , whose mother was .
without your husband &apos;s support , she was worried for a <unk> by the court , and she had <unk> him in her own case , and even bigger when she won .
&quot; is not , &quot; turned out to be <unk> .
i &apos;m just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> , and i looked at the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories , and they <unk> her , that we were still with them .
at midnight , the monk came , and he said he must close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you hold it in the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t released it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through women .
you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives , we would have come into the <unk> .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think about the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yes , i fear privilege , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave every wave <unk> , the <unk> , continuous <unk> of the engine , the vast horizon , which doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could make it safe , i would do it .
also , <unk> &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or five row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography at all ?
because this is , of course , a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
but my interest in photography began when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i combined it with my previous preference for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because the camera was doing the process in planning .
and if you put a picture with a camera , the process , if you squeeze on the trigger .
so , for me , it seemed to be more to go to photography in the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the catalyst is pushing .
photos like this : one construction site along a much <unk> street .
but it has a twist twist .
and still , there &apos;s a realistic level .
or photos like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all of the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to make it look like that , as if you could have it , in a picture .
the photographs that you have to think about a moment to find out the trick .
so it &apos;s about to capture an idea than a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it be realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface of a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think are realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality , where you take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three perfect <unk> objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , in a certain way , you can combine something that &apos;s still in <unk> , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brains don &apos;t just agree that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a realistic picture , i think it &apos;s the things that we &apos;re not thinking about , the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us .
but if we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look just wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to do a result of the outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that there should be the same perspective in perspective .
secondly , together , they should have the same <unk> .
and these two pictures meet these two requirements -- from the same height and the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s not possible to be different from where the individual images are starting and end by turning them into seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to say that the picture was actually put together .
so by the color , contrast and brightness of the edges on the edges of the individual images , things like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we <unk> the boundaries between the various images , and let them look like a single photo , even though a single picture can be basically hundreds of layers .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom of it is manipulated .
but this picture is completely completely composed of photos of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to make any compromise with the ideas in your mind .
but it requires a lot .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them , to find the different places for the pieces .
for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> .
the waterfront is from another place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red , to let it look swedish .
so , to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s going to work from me to go out .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s all very well planned .
and when you make good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that &apos;s limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced to the <unk> is to take a <unk> .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific about this -- she represents a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , how do you go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic <unk> fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i jumped on it .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job to 95 pounds coming .
it &apos;s very simple , every time i get on the scale , send my data on google health .
and they &apos;re also going to <unk> out of my <unk> , so that he can see where my <unk> is , not just at the moment that i need to support , and that &apos;s what i need to do with a glimpse of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know that , i have over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning , i &apos;m going to talk to my <unk> , and people talk to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; lunch is just a little salad today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it could have patients smoking at smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and to get them to play some kind of game together to control their health better .
next week , it comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to give you to an iphone or something like that .
and it &apos;s going to enable people to measure their blood pressure from home to their doctor and to share it with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t only take control , the captain on their own ship , but we can also help in the face of health care , in the face of the challenges that are in front of us and the health care of health , twice the demand and so on .
make the methods that are easy to use , and start embracing them in a team .
and they can do that through ways , but also by <unk> .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a short video .
we have all <unk> in our cars .
perhaps in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all those machines around <unk> are around .
we know another one where all petrol stations are .
and yeah , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next piece of <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the nearest life-saving <unk> was in that moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve set up a website and ask a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with us where he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> , they &apos;ve been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we have designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for design design , augmented reality , to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , you &apos;re also <unk> to find the next <unk> of life .
and from today , we don &apos;t just want to only as a result of how the product is called , but also , as a result .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , about helping us to behave like <unk> , to crowdsource these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and someone is collapsing , it &apos;s your own <unk> or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us for <unk> for <unk> .
they could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still in its place .
please help us , and try to improve the health , not just better , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little <unk> is that we would force ourselves to the environment by ...
and it &apos;s <unk> to get .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh , a moment .
it might take up until it &apos;s charged .
now , we can just skip it -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment , which is as pretty much everything you really hate , and we have it work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the computer geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed amazing apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s really looking for him when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at <unk> when it &apos;s a meter <unk> .
how did he come to look for this particular kind of thing ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston , which is called &quot; code for america . &quot;
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> on the last february of february .
and they found that the city never <unk> the city <unk> .
but one particular fellow , a guy named erik <unk> , he noticed something different , and that was that the residents of the sidewalks was free to be free before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> him free to <unk> when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a very humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows have written the last year .
but she does something that no other <unk> does .
it &apos;s rapidly expanding .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city , who saw that app could use this app not for snow , but to adopt the citizen leaders .
it &apos;s very important that these things work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check it .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the app to get the citizens to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago has just been introduced to the people who <unk> the <unk> when it <unk> .
we now know nine cities to use this app .
and it turns out to be very organic , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know it doesn &apos;t normally work that way .
the <unk> of software takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked in boston last year in boston , for three people and a half months .
it was about a way to figure out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we later told us that if it would go over the normal channels that would have taken it over two years , and it would have taken over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
now , there &apos;s a project in the california law that the taxpayer cost the taxpayer to have two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it turns out , it &apos;s a kind of a shot before the <unk> on the government .
it shows how the government could better work better -- not like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that you represent a new generation that <unk> the problem of government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who make the tools that we need to do to tackle things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people all over the country who are getting up and <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but you complain about it , they repair it .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget your feelings about politics and the snake in the <unk> and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what do we do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to ask you to do it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately takes their power from us -- <unk> you , &quot; we are the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect what this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought that in the government , it was mainly about choosing people .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s all about the community in the community .
this is the call call for service and information .
you usually get out there when you &apos;re <unk> in your city .
if you &apos;ve ever got a chance to work in your <unk> call , like our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all doing that -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who call the government for many different problems , including that there &apos;s a <unk> in your house .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause did .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call center .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called <unk> <unk> .
we haven &apos;t written this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , can &apos;t say if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott was <unk> by human .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we got , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned out on the side . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government got into <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped a different citizen , but the government played here in a central role .
it connected these two people .
and you could have been able to connect them to the government of government , if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
when an neighbor helps another neighbor , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we lean back and we expect the government to reflect our values and our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed a lot ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean and politics are the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word to this word in this way .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , and we &apos;re paying for something that lets us pay something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real thing is happening .
so we need to do to the machinery of government .
so the <unk> did it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of <unk> citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not politically active , which is <unk> .
well , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time to think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to ask .
do we really think we have to do what we need to do without improving an institution that can be done by all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government fundamentally <unk> in a way that can actually reach the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build these right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we all fight , about who is to talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can make your mind , on every channel , every time , and they do it .
so when you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care so much about using their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government .
and these apps we use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be to be a fire hydrant , to <unk> a <unk> , turn around a <unk> <unk> .
and sure , we would have <unk> these <unk> all over the time , and many people do it .
but these apps are like small digital memories , that we are not consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of the government that are willing to pay for taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got to you here : if it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
normally , my role in trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies , which are the emergence , are going to be , and i thought , because i &apos;m here with my friends , i &apos;d like to tell you what i really think . and also try to see what i &apos;m really going to do , and understand what i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
... if you &apos;ll just show the slide .
this is a slide i would have chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but in fact , the general shape .
and this slide shows an analysis of an analysis on the performance of <unk> processors compared to the power of a <unk> area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so many others , which we find in our field , a kind of just on a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power in the <unk> .
and this is an indication that we need to use this guy to be a scale on <unk> curves in technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could turn the light back up .
a little bit brighter because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
the reason for this is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , so the timeline of one way , and this is a chemical measure of technology that i want to pose with a graph , then the graph is silly .
so they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to map a different technology , we &apos;ll just say a <unk> , then that would go on the <unk> scale , scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this is happening here , it changes the <unk> circumstance .
so , if the <unk> was going to be the <unk> , then we could go into a taxi in a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , by which the order of the scale , every few years , increase exponentially .
now , the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go on it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything &apos;s always evolved forever as fast as now .
there are two options .
you &apos;re either going to get a classic <unk> like this , to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s like this .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really like that , then that means we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world in a new kind of transition .
so the question i want to ask , and i often want to imagine what this new world is going to be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and we go beyond that .
so in other words , the future has shrunk to a year since i &apos;ve been on this world .
i think the reason that we realize that there is something happening .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know it simply doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different , that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
so i want to talk now about what this might be , this transition where we are right now .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have anything with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the point at a longer <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life on earth .
i think the picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back and 2.5 billion years , and it was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you &apos;ve been looking at the way these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture of how they <unk> the <unk> .
i think there are theories that starting to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of this , which is , at that time , little <unk> <unk> , which <unk> different kinds of chemicals in chemicals .
some of these <unk> had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow .
all the ones that were , began to divide .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> .
but they weren &apos;t about the fact that they were in the sense of life , because each one was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they &apos;re distributed to disparate amounts of chemicals .
so each one was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> grew , which had one for the growth of the growth faster than others and integrated more chemicals and more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
so these tend to survive longer , and these tend to go into an extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it becomes when this <unk> learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , this is the ability to have learned the ability to use information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe for the cell as the information , which is in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this <unk> , evolutionary way that allowed them to do , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing is that this kind of thing is to store the information over the time of 2.5 billion years where they were born , the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and each creature is using exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we do , just to the <unk> , in this code .
and i have a hundred <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of <unk> .
it &apos;s in it -- what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is a normal letter that we use for the <unk> -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i have 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of mine , i have enough for everybody in this room and even anyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had been a <unk> in reality , i would have written it on a virus and open it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s where these cells were started to communicate and share information so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew , but bacteria can actually share their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , the consistency grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and put this information together with other bacteria with the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now , this communication allowed the reasons of communities , which in some sense were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more , and by evolution .
now , the <unk> is so close to where these communities are so close to <unk> the recipe for the whole community to write into the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so forth .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the level of which evolution was going on , no longer the individual cell , but the whole thing that we call organism .
the next step was happening within these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that had nothing else to do as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> , which have built these <unk> .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and to hold that information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- learning happened in the period of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so , one organism was able to learn to eat a certain fruit , because she didn &apos;t <unk> and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of an individual organism , whereas it had been taken hundreds of thousands of years ago because this information has had to be learned from the individuals that died because of these fruit cells , there were no present .
so the nervous system actually has the <unk> using this particular <unk> , because evolution could be within one individual .
it could take place within the time .
what happened after that is that individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so , as example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a rather amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically <unk> sounds of me , in the hope of creating a similar <unk> idea in your head that has a kind of like my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , transforming it in sound , a sequence of sound , and they produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this is now allowing us again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we know , humanity is , we have started to abstract .
we <unk> the same steps that <unk> has gone through -- the abstraction of our techniques , how we process data .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle that information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also capable of developing faster than we were so far .
so today , evolution can happen in the amount of microseconds of microseconds .
you also have seen <unk> little <unk> , where he &apos;s shown a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> <unk> again .
the first steps of history that i told you , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , they seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding itself and becomes , so i think <unk> is the word for this -- if something is <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feeding itself .
i &apos;m living from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i &apos;m using to build computers , not to use , without the recent advances in computer computing .
my current practice is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in <unk> power .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what &apos;s also doing the designers of thinking <unk> , we think of a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to think of a <unk> , and this is what makes our skills far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do it themselves .
and it makes it part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand .
now , a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been doing lately is evolution itself .
that &apos;s what we put in the machine where it &apos;s going on in the <unk> machine .
so , to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , give them a hundred million million randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
now , all these randomly chosen chosen instructions are going to lead to all the programs , and then finally , the people who are going to be the next one . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for it .
so find programs that can sort of place numbers .
and , of course , the chance in random elected opportunity is very small , they &apos;re very small , that they don &apos;t think of the instructions , so don &apos;t think of the instructions .
but one of them may have two numbers of happiness in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve come to the next .
store them , <unk> the rest .
now <unk> all the <unk> that numbers have to have .
and this is a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are <unk> the characteristics of these two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come closer to what they are than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
get back again .
take some mutations .
and try it again with another generation .
all these generations require a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through an evolution over millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or in more complex cases , a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can sort numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write about .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s abstruse and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure they do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their life depended on whether they did the job .
and i sat down in a 747 with marvin <unk> , he <unk> a map and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane out of <unk> <unk> , which work together to make your flight safer , &apos; does that not ?
we know it &apos;s not being optimal , if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process which is very different from the classical engineering process .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the opportunity .
so we <unk> the technology .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computers much faster , so that we &apos;re able to do these processes even faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it becomes faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies now are feeding themselves .
we lift up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog to the time , as <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really make what the hell we &apos;re doing here .
we are in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that there &apos;s another thing .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever is coming next .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here before i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story begins in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was in the <unk> sky , with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian <unk> &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted indian to travel at the time , we were going into a car and <unk> about the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
then when the great indian <unk> <unk> thirst , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got a fear of technology .
i &apos;m afraid that i could lose the ability to be able to enjoy the sunset without a camera and no tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill magic .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships and <unk> in my imagination .
it occurred to me , when we thought our <unk> and cameras from being dreams .
they were <unk> by being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to enable magic instead of killing magic .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling to connect the readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it bring pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling is needed more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
this says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and it becomes a character in the book .
and again , a letter is going down for me -- and the ipad knows by gps , where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean not a magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found always quite exciting .
that &apos;s how you have to flip the ipad , fireflies are <unk> .
and the light shows the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that there can be a whole galaxy in a single <unk> galaxy .
and so here &apos;s a book , and every single world is a little bit of a <unk> that i take here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always cards , but these cards were static .
and this map grows , and it &apos;s shining , and it serves for orientation in the rest of the book .
it turns out to be the other point of the book .
i go in here .
also , for me , it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> have been caught in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary history of children .
it &apos;s a story that &apos;s related to new issues like the <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids in their dorm rooms , on their dorm rooms , without going out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;ll be sent to a search . you have to go out and do the camera of the ipads image of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do .
this is <unk> . you have to go out to put a picture of a flower and tag .
in a other chapter , you have to <unk> a piece of <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online .
a child in london is a picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social system around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology .
so in the next book , we &apos;re going to do an interaction where you use the ipads , and by reality reality , looking at an animation of <unk> that appear to be a plant in front of the house .
in one place , the screen is filling up with leaves .
you have to make the sound of <unk> , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology come closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the power of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood by the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor to me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prison or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the socially socially social and places where there &apos;s plenty of hopelessness .
being here at ted , to see and hear how stimulating that is , i gave a lot of power .
so in the short time here , i realized , ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes , when something comes over ted gets a meaning and force that otherwise doesn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but the words of a dedicated best teacher is meaningful .
you can do good , as a doctor , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , which was dominated by a <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as slaves .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery really shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and <unk> me .
she hit me so that i couldn &apos;t breathe , and then she made me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel still my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she said to me again . if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; let me quiet .
she was something that made it you wanted to be near her .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to have eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins were walking around .
my grandmother was at the end of the <unk> and staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
it was like 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came over to me . she took me over the hand , and she said , &quot; come on , <unk> . you and me , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember that it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
and she took me out with the outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise you you don &apos;t get it back . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; the first thing she said is that you will always love your mama always . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise to promise you &apos;re going to take care of you . &quot;
so i kept my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , next to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise to me is , &quot; you never get alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is older and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i got this <unk> beer with her sister and i went to the forest .
we &apos;re just <unk> around there as anything else .
and then he took a drink beer and offered to my sister , and she took me on , and then offering me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . you &apos;re ok . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; well , do we do . now we &apos;re doing that , you know what we do .
i had what , my sister had a beer . go to a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . do you just do . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , <unk> . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to do you still crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to confess something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do this .
this is probably going to be publicly transmitted .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m <unk> that i &apos;ve never drunk a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say it &apos;s because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us and tell people about things that they first don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course my grandmother would say all her grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in jail during the <unk> prison .
my uncle died in <unk> diseases .
and she believed that this is the themes that we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in jail .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today is the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are released on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , <unk> has changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population are despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three men &apos;s black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on the place of <unk> or <unk> .
in urban communities , all over the country -- of los angeles of philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black men in prison , in the prison at <unk> , or on <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not just kind of shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s going to be destroyed by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they treat much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty of as poor as poor .
assets , not <unk> , it affects the outcome .
and yet , we seem to be quite satisfied .
a policy of politics and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some <unk> developments .
my home state alabama is pulling them continuously if you &apos;re convicted of <unk> .
here , and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population will keep lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the ratio of the civic <unk> is going to be so high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that <unk> children to death in jail .
in this country , for children , there are <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we think that &apos;s because we &apos;ve taught us that the real question is , has a human being made to die for a human being in <unk> ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : anybody deserves a crimes of death , but do we deserve to kill it ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people that we have executed , one that we &apos;ve found for innocent who were <unk> and from death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let someone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes that will take off .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking to my students african-american story . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the world &apos;s time , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you talk , they &apos;re holding talks . they tell the people that they should stop saying that , for the first time in our nation in our nation , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated surrender and apartheid .
and yet there is a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> don &apos;t get over without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness to , but not in that country .
i &apos;ve held some talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear them . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give it anymore in germany . &quot;
there was a silence . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill ourselves for the systematic way of people .
it would be <unk> of us , consciously and <unk> people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state had <unk> people , especially if there was a lot of their jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we put people down -- here &apos;s the risk of being sentenced to death , 11 times higher when the victim is black , if the victim is black , and the victim knows -- in the same states .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we &apos;re not dealing with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities become <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to get in a complex world .
for me , the time creating time , thinking and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged that will never be at ted .
but think about a way that is integrated in our own lives .
we all need to believe things we can &apos;t see .
we do that . we &apos;re as rational as we &apos;re also rational , so much we value .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> that i believe that drives us , not just being open for all the bright and <unk> things , but for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted everything to do , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that the <unk> have to be engaged in it .
there &apos;s no <unk> about technology and design that allows us to be very human , as long as we don &apos;t have your eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more about us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
it will touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i did the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and again , woman park came back to <unk> , where they had two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , who had organized the <unk> <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white man , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were meeting and talked themselves .
and then , then , i called a woman called me and said , &quot; <unk> , woman park come in the city . we want a conversation .
do you want <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen .
and i went over and listened to .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , women turned to me to tell us , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the same initiative is in the same .
what do you try ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work on injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were innocent innocent .
we want to fight bias in the <unk> .
we want to have <unk> <unk> without having genetic <unk> for children .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death down .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot; <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then he rejected himself to me , he put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to make ways to make these challenges : these problems , that &apos;s suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our all humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
if somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to him , it &apos;s not just a burglar .
even who kills someone , it &apos;s not just a murderer .
and because this is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and in many parts of the planet , in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so <unk> , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not to the things we develop , not on our intellect and mind .
finally , a society is not treated as they treat their rich and powerful and privileged and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in that context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story for the end .
sometimes i push too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas , sometimes , of our thinking ahead , in a very important way .
i <unk> these children who were convicted of very hard punishment .
i &apos;m going to go to <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , to be an adult in the court .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn into something that it isn &apos;t ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
i stayed up for a long night , and i thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn into something different , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also want you to want .
and because it was late , and i didn &apos;t really think more , i started working on a hunger .
i had a <unk> , poor black boy as clients .
and i started with this , and the headline said , &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black client like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
in my bill , i explained that <unk> of the <unk> and the police and <unk> are <unk> .
there was a crazy line that there was nothing more <unk> in this country that there are only error .
and the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i &apos;ve just dreamed of this crazy thing or actually written him .
and to my horror , i had not only written him , but sent to the dish .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to be in the dish , and this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
and finally , i went out of my car , and i went up the staircase .
when i was the staircase on the court , he was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
and when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of it . &quot;
and i have to say , there were power .
it touched a little bit deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute to each one , to a sense of hope , to a sense of hope .
well , i walked into the <unk> .
the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you ask these crazy ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry , that we talked about color languages about poverty , about poverty .
i saw the janitors in my <unk> , and i saw the janitors .
he always looked around the window and could hear the whole thing .
he went on and down .
and finally , this older black man came up with a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and she sat directly behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
and during the break , the <unk> came in and she felt that the janitors were in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran across to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here here to say this young man , don &apos;t give the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far <unk> , but it &apos;s the justice community .
that as humans , we &apos;re not fully designed , unless we care about human rights and <unk> .
that all of our survival is linked to survival .
we have to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who are just saying , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
you have seen in this audience , this community , the obvious wish , is to help them and do something .
what can we do yet ?
<unk> <unk> : well there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to businesses , something about the <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s going to be flowing into politics .
here , california , for example , is going to be a billion dollars for the death penalty years to death penalty one billion dollars .
and yet <unk> percent of all <unk> are not with a <unk> .
56 percent of all <unk> are not coming in court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
so this <unk> is going to suggest that to invest money in more security and security .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the united states was enormously down in america .
and this is the fact that a lot of the things that often have been put in a relationship .
what would you tell someone that believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t change very much .
the majority of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the classroom .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers are coming in in a prison .
we have <unk> from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> <unk> , the people who get behind bars , for a <unk> , for the theft of that theft , rather than that you forces them to give back the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i believe that our current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they actually put an string string here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
now , bin laden &apos;s death is an increased <unk> system .
two : famine in somalia , o.c. spray is three : o.c. spray .
four : invasive <unk> . five : dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . seven : 65 dead .
8 : <unk> . 9 : <unk> .
different speakers . mass destruction . <unk> .
recession . gridlock . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of these clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects , because our mind gives attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second every second , our senses can get much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is a part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning , our <unk> .
it was <unk> and <unk> all the information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it goes up , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , the seven days the day , 24 hours a day of all this negative news , is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always going to be worse .
but it may not be the case .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
it may accelerate enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century in the last century , so strongly that it &apos;s possible for the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , water crisis , water and <unk> -- we have already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better in seeing problems in a very long way , but they &apos;re finally going to be overcome .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so that we can anticipate development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which is in inflation , which is <unk> .
child mortality has reduce a tenth of a tenth .
and that &apos;s where the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and costs themselves to a pair of times .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful period of life .
and by the fact that charles <unk> has gone from 25 percent for 25 percent over the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep our expectations on the time .
in fact , we &apos;re redefining poverty .
remember that a great percentage of americans who live below the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , cell phones , <unk> and cars .
the richest , the richest , of the last century , the earth &apos;s <unk> of the earth would never have been able to have such a <unk> .
the basis of a lot of these are forming technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to take to the information technology that makes great leaps on moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> of all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and it &apos;s thousands of times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it is -- in good like bad times , war or peace , recession , depression , <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it &apos;s slowing down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your logarithmic <unk> on the left side , it &apos;s going up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of them .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends call &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors and networks , robots and networks , robots , robots , that allow us to have the personal production of production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> <unk> supercomputer at risk ?
that was great .
i took the newspapers and i looked for the best headlines that i could find .
i love that , &quot; watson <unk> human beings . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that that artificial intelligence would each owner would be available to each other .
four years ago , four kurzweil and i started here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies , which are special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , creating products and services , within a decade , the life of billions of people can influence .
think about that a group of students today can influence life from billions of people today .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
now , today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s all about making goods from <unk> .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is an resources of <unk> power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself , got <unk> .
the king of <unk> was getting <unk> .
aluminum was at that time the valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is the reason why the dome is made of aluminum designed .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> is not as pure metal .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of <unk> is developed and made it so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we &apos;re thinking of <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> of energy <unk> all <unk> minutes on the ground .
it &apos;s not the scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar dropped by the last year by 50 percent .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sun in the sun , solar energy is going to be $ 6 per capita than 15 cents on national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water in the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember that as carl sagan in 1990 , when it was at saturn <unk> , turned back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we fight about 0.5 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean kamen , one of the innovators to do it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , which is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and that many of you may have heard of . it has the size of a <unk> .
it can create a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less cents a gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just been <unk> to start a big <unk> in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then a coca-cola will apply to this technology globally in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation , which is today .
and we &apos;ve seen this on mobile phones .
you mean , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
remember that a <unk> with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> for president reagan , 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information for 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance , as no one would have ever had predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you &apos;ve spent , and i &apos;ve spent several thousands of dollars -- gps , <unk> and photo , libraries and a picture , libraries and medical diagnostics -- now are now getting <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is perhaps what we expect in health .
i had the pleasure of the last month with the <unk> , which is called $ 10 million <unk> &apos;s x prize .
we ask teams all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it can be equipped with ai , you can test or test your <unk> .
and to win , this device has to diagnosis a better diagnosis than a team <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of health care .
if this device is sequenced a <unk> or <unk> sequenced , which is not known , it calls the disease disease and prevents a pandemic in front of their outbreak .
but now to the biggest force we &apos;re going to lead to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we just crossed the <unk> .
and only by the way , the biggest <unk> against a population explosion is a better education and diet around the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we increase two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , will join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of ecological europe , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars going into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be able to be healthier , and they &apos;re getting more trained by the <unk> , and by doing it , you &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d printers and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion of growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> ?
how about a sentence , never before <unk> voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to pay attention and make change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people will bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams who are motivated by passion and focus , extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some may be familiar .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s solved .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein is going to develop .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played from university professors etc .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people that play the game online .
and it showed that these days , the human pattern recognition is better the proteins than the great supercomputer .
and when those people came and looked at who &apos;s the best part of the world , it wasn &apos;t a <unk> , no <unk> , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working as an assistant assistant at the day of <unk> , and at night , the best part of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s an enormous thing about our future , is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to make us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to address the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been a long time in business than i can give me a piece of my own <unk> <unk> to allow that to happen .
but before i get to my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the world cup and moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is filled with great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems soon , and about statistics and to use this to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to share with a statistics that i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat &apos;s beating .
that means that the player will make three three beats .
that means that the ball hits the <unk> , he &apos;s going to come up , he &apos;s not caught up , and who &apos;s trying to take the ball to the first base , didn &apos;t get done on time and it was in security .
three from 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
good , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is one of the rest of the rest of the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player who met during an <unk> season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back into my world of medicine , which i feel about some more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less , or maybe a little bit less , i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have a <unk> , which is 400 in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they &apos;ve got a loved people with <unk> <unk> , and her <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in 200 .
but , but you know what ?
she &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s <unk> .
and she &apos;s beating .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or <unk> should be .
what we do though is that we &apos;re including each of them , including , in the world , are perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s going to do the details of how to be done that .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a obsessive <unk> student .
in high school , in high school times , the <unk> would say that brian was learning for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> , the sisters in the toronto , <unk> <unk> hospital .
i memorized everything .
in my graduate school , i learned the origins and the tail of every <unk> , every branch of each of the artery , which from the ascending aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s the time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed up with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i memorized all , and i knew everything , or at least as much as possible as possible , as close as possible that i &apos;m immune to making mistakes .
and it worked for for a while , until i met woman .
i &apos;m <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman in the hospital hospital .
at that point , i was the <unk> layer in <unk> service .
and it was my assignment when the <unk> <unk> was looking for studying the <unk> .
and give feedback to my <unk> .
i studied her wife &apos;s printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest with the <unk> , i was able to hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was under <unk> failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails , rather than pump the entire blood on the lung , and you hold up a part of the blood blood in your lung , and filling out these gradually , so the <unk> came .
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
i asked them , and i went to treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> water , and they <unk> the liquid .
and over a year and a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t get to put on them , and i did what i should have had a call , what a call in my <unk> would have been to do with him , so that he had a chance to have a single picture .
and he knew her , he &apos;d had extra information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the smartest doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was like , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent them home , i <unk> a little voice in me that was trying to say to me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , i was missing so much to me that i asked the nurse who was taking care of her wife , &quot; believe that it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it , and the nurse was like , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was just yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> , and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day that evening i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day , i packed my things , that the hospital , and went to the parking lot to go home with the car when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home in my way home .
and there &apos;s another nurse , and i didn &apos;t see the nurse who had seen her wife , but another three words to me and those three words fear that i know .
other people fear these equally , but the <unk> is especially because we just see the patients as soon as we are .
three words loud : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you thought ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she got at home , after i sent her home , she was on the family , and the family , they took them back on the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
they didn &apos;t breathe and got blue <unk> .
the <unk> moved all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them on the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was in shocked .
and i go through this rollercoaster through the <unk> of the <unk> , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , she realized she never would awakening .
she didn &apos;t have an <unk> injury .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they went to the <unk> .
on the day of day , you <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you never forget the names of the world .
and that was the first time that i learned this .
the next couple of weeks , i said , and i was discovering , for the first time , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt in isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s best , even though that one on <unk> <unk> and then you get one of the best friend you &apos;re going to put in it and give you a terrible discussion , if you can &apos;t do it , you can never do such a mistake .
if you do <unk> and never do the mistake .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes a <unk> sick .
it &apos;s the one that tells you that not what you &apos;re doing is not what you &apos;re doing is bad , you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason for me , he was very happy .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was using this <unk> and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why did i not ask the <unk> ? why do i do it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a dumb mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but it certainly put it out .
i started feeling better .
and then one day of a day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i said , maybe i can feel better again .
and i was like that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again a mistake that the voice could <unk> .
and she did .
and i kept working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in a <unk> hospital , north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to talk to her office .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the <unk> ? &quot;
and it turned out to be a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but the top <unk> , and causes the <unk> .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> , and he recovered .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , and she felt <unk> , and went back to work until it was again and again and again .
i &apos;ve missed two times an <unk> .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of things to think about , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that only 14 patients had a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no imperfections in their treatment .
i thought he was a <unk> .
i <unk> the x-ray of the kidneys , and when it was without <unk> , my colleague , in the lower right sector , was stuck with a <unk> in the lower right sector , and called the <unk> .
the other person had severe diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him , and i asked my colleagues as well .
and he did , and he was starting to see a <unk> in the right sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was fine .
both cases <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst error only happened in the first five years of what many of my colleagues are saying , but total nonsense .
some of my favorites in the last five years .
alone , embarrassed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not going to end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk to the quiet voice that really did not happen , how can i do it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you have heard the last time of somebody who talked about <unk> <unk> on <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you might hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about your fault .
if i had a room full of colleagues , and ask their immediate support , and i started telling you what i just told you about , i wouldn &apos;t be able to do the end of the second story before it was really uncomfortable to make a joke , and you &apos;d forget the issue and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i or my colleagues know that a <unk> in my hospital would have a wrong leg in my hospital , you think i had trouble looking at him .
that &apos;s the system where we live .
it &apos;s quite denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who don &apos;t do . those who are <unk> <unk> and without limitation that results with bad results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies to attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make the mistakes in the medicine that we make a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical history and journalism , i created a personal medical study and false treatments so everything i could do for one of my first article , which i wrote for the toronto star , which i wrote to my show , &quot; white art , &quot; wrote .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system where we &apos;re doing errors every day in which one of 10 is either a false or false <unk> , which is always going to be more wrong , and it &apos;s always going to be large and large and dead or dead .
in this state , around 24,000 canadians die in <unk> canadians .
in the united states , the institute of medicine , the institute of 100,000 .
both of them are strong because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and is the <unk> .
in a <unk> where medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own cognitive error , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> , and i &apos;ll give you a slightly <unk> breath , and suddenly the story of <unk> is in <unk> .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of these are essentially inevitable .
so if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , it &apos;s been taught , and it gets rid of all the <unk> <unk> , then there &apos;s no more left .
and you know about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; i &apos;ve got the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; blah , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah .
and then their pupils will expand , and they &apos;ve come up with the head , and they &apos;ve come down , and you &apos;ll go down and eat it , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , do not the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is an environment that gives them to be able to put in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the <unk> is a doctor , knows , to know his humanity , accepted , is not proud of making mistakes , but put everything out of it , so that it can be passed on .
she shares their experiences with others .
it supports others of their mistakes .
and it tells others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a loving , supportive way that everybody benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when it &apos;s like that , people also make mistakes at time .
so that the system has evolved to create <unk> , which make it easier to find mistakes that people are doing , and it enables them to create loving , supportive spaces where anyone who is watching the potential error and actually respond to it , and that &apos;s reward .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to pass it into it to pass it together .
i don &apos;t know what they hold me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to give you three stories .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you probably know that he was <unk> here .
you like to think that he would hunt <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as very common .
it was a <unk> .
up to the &apos; 80s , it &apos;s got fish in great style .
now it &apos;s endangered species on the red list .
this story , we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or in other places , it &apos;s not very special .
however , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> describe it still as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to be able to make another concept , <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 a lagoon .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t have it from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon in <unk> and by a few mangroves .
there were <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were good for them and they were making a lot of them in ghana .
when i got back there , the fish had shrunk to half its size .
adults are about five inches .
they were genetically <unk> .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was lucky to be still there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it changed everything .
my third little story is telling my <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather , at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe .
<unk> meant the countries that started from 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing fishing in this rather ugly ship called <unk> .
i was driving on it , and we did it all the <unk> in the southern hemisphere , and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically the bottom of the sea came up , and then it became <unk> .
these images are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
and within a year , you have a survey and then start with the <unk> fishing .
the reason is changing . in this case -- a hard reason , or soft , <unk> crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a alive .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of rubble is , every time they drive from fishers , when they drive in areas that have never been published .
it &apos;s not going to documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our <unk> of the new level , and we don &apos;t remember what was there .
if you get rid of it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
the time it changes . it &apos;s changing , because for people , their actions are naturally .
each generation looks at the images that they &apos;re beginning to do at the beginning of their conscious life , as the standard and it &apos;s going to derive everything from that .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they would only get the <unk> remains .
and that is now , basically , our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not as much as they were .
you could now think that the problem of people was living on when they lived in <unk> societies , they were killing animals , and they were aware of a few generations , what they had done .
because , obviously , an animal that had a very common thing that was very often even rare before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have a more natural animal animals .
you &apos;re always losing animals .
and that &apos;s why it won &apos;t be a big loss .
the time we focus on the big animals and the sea is the big fish .
they get less rare because we &apos;re catching them .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why do people accept .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people will tell , scientists , tell you that it was really different .
you &apos;ll confirm it , because the evidence of how they are in a previous shape are not as much as you would like to make the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report that the report was in large <unk> in this area can &apos;t be used , or by <unk> , usually not <unk> , because it &apos;s not a scientific scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role of a marine reserve .
because at marine reserves , we basically put the past again .
we &apos;re making the past again that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> are changing and very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve and benefit from the insight that allows it to have to reset their <unk> .
what about the people that aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have access to -- people in the midwest in the midwest ?
here , i think , the art and the film may be associated with the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
there was <unk> a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why the people were touched by this -- except from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in some way .
so my suggestion , the only one i &apos;m going to do is cameron of cameron that &apos;s turning it out underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , in communist , you had to have to do if you owned a typewriter in the government .
they also had to register a paper from this typewriter from a typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much the freedom of speech was going to be .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , you can buy a new <unk> of the leading <unk> and print one side of this , and then this page is yellow <unk> on each side , in a pattern that makes the page clearly on you and your printer .
this is happening today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be more like that .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> from the existing ocean today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> in ukraine for example .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> that have made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so forth .
these people have come online to wealth online , but they made it illegal by using <unk> to steal money out of our <unk> , while we &apos;re doing our <unk> , or <unk> , which we &apos;ve collected on the keyboard on the keyboard while we &apos;re shopping online .
the american intelligence agency , two months ago , was the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account , were <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on free foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i claim that it &apos;s more likely to be that we become victims of a <unk> , as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
and the second biggest <unk> we can see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests like , you think , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous have moved over the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it for money , <unk> such as anonymous that are doing with it , but the last group is nations , governments who lead the attacks .
that &apos;s where we have cases , like the <unk> .
it shows a matter of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- and it was that .
in the last fall , it had to be <unk> , because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody has been hacked , hacked the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior people who were able to ask the question of whether he had died because of the <unk> people .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in such a remote hacks ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , if you have a website with <unk> of service , for example .
now we &apos;re all using , or a lot of us , gmail or one of their competitors are very common in <unk> states like iran , where iran use foreign companies like gmail , because they know that they can use more trust as local <unk> , so you know that the local government can &apos;t <unk> into their conversation .
but , you know , if you go into a foreign tree .
<unk> hacking and fake <unk> wrote .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of <unk> .
how does it behave with the arab spring and things that are happening for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , in egypt , the author in april of 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in that records , a folder was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were a local company in germany that had sold a few programs of the egyptian government that they could absorb in very large framework -- any <unk> of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 12 euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments provide governments &apos; governments to be able to work against their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , we found <unk> , which was a <unk> , which was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , it &apos;s pretty likely to <unk> your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap into your internet connection .
they use resources like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
i have to give privacy .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we do today , in the year 2011 , our governments like trust , but every right that we &apos;re going to make it forever .
and then we trust that we trust any future government , a government that we may be in 50 years ?
these are the questions we have to engage in the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : modules , <unk> , cement , set measurements that fit .
<unk> became very quickly <unk> <unk> in the world .
they gave us to build things that were larger than we were , buildings , bridges , a stone after another .
and basically , the <unk> had become the <unk> of our time .
almost a hundred years later , some lego that came out there .
it was called &quot; automatically <unk> stone .
and within less years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones , or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically has the <unk> , the building block of the world , took a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at bell labs , the next revolution , he announced the next revolution , the next building .
the transistor was a small <unk> that was <unk> us from a world of static , <unk> building blocks to a world that would be interactive .
like the <unk> , it allows us to build much larger , more complex loops , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
and personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is reserved for , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of artists in artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
so they can &apos;t put them wrong around them .
the stones are <unk> .
green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so all you need to do is to connect a blue and a green one , and they can build a very quickly greater <unk> .
they add a blue one on a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so they created a little <unk> .
take a switch out to a <unk> , which is here , and you made a little <unk> .
and you put this <unk> effect for an extra effect , and they made a <unk> effect .
i &apos;ll stop that .
talking about the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of coding , you have to program , or <unk> , allows you to program <unk> with simple , intuitive gestures .
so , in order to accelerate it , or slow down , just turn on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a <unk> rock .
lights , notes , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> at children , and you see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is how you start to understand the electronics that surrounds them in the everyday world , and they don &apos;t learn from school .
like , for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors to the <unk> <unk> , or like an ipod to touch .
we also have <unk> <unk> .
so , for example , we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that began to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we &apos;ve brought risd to risd , and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-doh that fear has in the darkness .
and for those <unk> , it was another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so open source is open source .
you can go to the website , and download all of them as you can .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , to encourage the <unk> , because this world we live in , this interactive world , belongs .
so , pull out and start to invent it .
thank you .
