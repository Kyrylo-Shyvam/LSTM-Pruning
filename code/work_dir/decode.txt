you know , one of the great <unk> in the travels and one of the joy in <unk> research is to live with people who are still able to remember the old days , and they still feel the wind still in the wind , touch them in the bitter sheets of plants .
just knowing that <unk> are still traveling beyond the milky way , or the importance of the oldest of inuit the oldest of inuit , or that , in the himalayas , the buddhists still exists the breath of the anthropology to memory , is the idea that the <unk> of anthropology have not existed in an absolute sense , but it &apos;s just as a model of reality .
and of course , we &apos;re sharing the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to be <unk> by <unk> <unk> by death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s in the woods in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara , and this happens to be a <unk> in the middle of the sahara , or a <unk> of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are other kinds of <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking on earth are different ways .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , it can only fulfill hope .
together , the <unk> cultures of the world form a network of <unk> and <unk> life that &apos;s the earth <unk> , and for the sake of the earth , as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and <unk> , as a result of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , <unk> and intuitions that have been produced by the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re able to do as an amazing species .
and just the same way that the biosphere became strong , this happened with the <unk> -- only with greater speed .
a biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are in front of extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the area of biodiversity -- is very much about what is known to us as <unk> <unk> in the area of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is dying of languages .
when each of you have been born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
now a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
one language is the expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul will find access to the physical world .
any language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , today , as we &apos;re in monterey , they &apos;re not sitting in monterey .
they &apos;re not taught anymore . it means that if nothing is being done , it &apos;s actually dead already .
what could be more lonely than being <unk> , to be one of the last of your people who talk to your language , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of children ?
and yet , this terrible destiny actually happens to someone on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly dies and takes the last <unk> of an old language to the grave .
and i know some of you will say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t the world a better place if we all just talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s go , &quot; well , let &apos;s be <unk> .
be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly they would see how it would be if you could not talk to your own language .
that &apos;s why i want to take you on a journey today through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to understand them , which is actually lost .
now , there are some of us who forget that , in a sense , i say , &quot; different possibilities of his own , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
so , for example , take this child in the northwest of the amazon in the amazon , the people in the amazon , believe they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people that are not cognitively different between the colors and green , because the <unk> of the forest that people depend depend on .
you &apos;ve got a strange language and a <unk> that &apos;s called linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who speaks a different language .
all of this is rooted in the <unk> past , and it &apos;s curious about these big houses where there &apos;s six or seven languages spoken in , however , you never hear somebody who learns a language .
they &apos;re just listening to them and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first people of the year 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> were trying to take contact with a <unk> mistake .
they threw <unk> photos from the air down , which we would be known as a friendly gesture . they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives never seen something more .
they took these photographs of the forest floor , trying to see the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and <unk> that this is business cards , and they killed the five <unk> of the devil .
but they didn &apos;t just kill a look at a look at the <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we were looking at eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death story , and when we <unk> people with a <unk> something about it , they gave that one of the people was so old that he died , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of forest that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps , and determine which species of this owned .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing task , when my professor at harvard was wondering if i was interested in doing haiti , to infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the poison that were used to make <unk> .
now , to give a sense of a sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them to be the great world of world , what would they say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that there is no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was one religious belief , and <unk> is simply the remains of this very profound religious thought that the tragic diaspora <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the people are giving the spirits .
spirits out of the big water are going to be <unk> , answers to the rhythm of dance , to <unk> the soul of life , so that the <unk> for a very bright moment is going to be the god .
<unk> people like to say , &quot; your white go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be taken away from the mind . how can you damage to harm ?
and look at this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal without burning combustion , an amazing graph of the spirit of the mind that it &apos;s <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met was the <unk> from the sierra nevada , named santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old <unk> civilization , who populated the caribbean <unk> of colombia , and in the aftermath of the conquest , this people went into a <unk> <unk> massive back to the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the <unk> .
to the day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , which is education , but education is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are separated at age three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> at the base of the glacier for 18 years , on the base of the glacier for 18 years -- two periods of time to mimic the pregnancy that spent her <unk> mother , spend now <unk> in the lap of a great mother .
and all over this time , they &apos;re culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers , and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- or we might say the ecological .
and at the end of these amazing <unk> , they &apos;re suddenly taken out of the outside one day , and for the first time in her life , at age 18 , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness , when the sun begins , when the sun begins to <unk> , all of a sudden , all of all the things that they learned in the abstract <unk> landscape , suddenly all of a sudden .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and saying that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think about native <unk> and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> , and the old myth of the really really really <unk> <unk> <unk> , which in his simplification is a <unk> thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more with nature .
so , native is neither <unk> , they &apos;re still <unk> by the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t get much space for it in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold <unk> of tibet , but they still have , through time and ritual , is shaped a mysterious <unk> of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of you , but in a very common intuition , the earth can exist .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andes , which is growing up in faith that the mountain is a <unk> , who will be a fate of the mountain or your fate , will be a very different person , and a very different relationship with this resource , or this place , is a bunch of stones in montana .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a pile of <unk> is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> columbia and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
and that made me to another human being as my friends under the <unk> who believe that these forests of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits to the <unk> of the world , spirits out to participate in their <unk> .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took just last april in the forest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful <unk> compound from the repertoire of the <unk> .
what &apos;s fascinating is not just the potential potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources , and on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden <unk> , which is a series of <unk> <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , light <unk> , so it &apos;s going to have a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong things that serotonin , <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> of this stuff , this kind of substance , this substance that you can create from various species also contains .
the powder is kind of like a <unk> at it , <unk> from <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it will not create distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the discovery of the magical mushrooms in mexico in the years of the <unk> <unk> , talking about this , and i said you couldn &apos;t feel that <unk> , because in the moment you can &apos;t experience this <unk> .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be taken away from a human gut because it &apos;s <unk> , of course , in the human gut , it will be <unk> .
they can only be taken in connection with some other chemicals that the mao <unk> .
now the amazing thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> are <unk> of exactly the way that &apos;s necessary to <unk> the <unk> .
how can these people from 80,000 form of 80,000 species can &apos;t find these two <unk> plants that are combined , which , if in this way , combine a kind of <unk> version , so that this is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and mistakes , which it turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> , which you can see all of the big distance in the woods that are in our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how to justify your <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you can take each of the 17 varieties of <unk> on <unk> and they sing in a different <unk> .
well , that doesn &apos;t take you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem of the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy of the very difficult position of rights , you look at as a <unk> and <unk> , but somehow to the past , as the real world , the way our world .
so , the fact is that you don &apos;t remember the 20th century , in 300 years , 300 years ago , not for his war or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we were present and the massive destruction of the <unk> and cultural diversity on earth either active and passively accepted .
all cultures have been involved in the dance again in the dance .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> didn &apos;t hear less the sioux when they bow and arrow tasks when americans stopped being americans when they stopped horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the extinction of the extinction . this is dynamic living peoples that lived through <unk> forces , which is being <unk> through the capacity of <unk> forces , which has been <unk> through the capacity of the <unk> in the forest , in a <unk> of <unk> , which has been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i study a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people will be convicted of people in general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lives of the human being , is not not a convicted , but generally celebrated as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering from <unk> , if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the <unk> level .
i once traveled to a young colleague <unk> miles from <unk> in <unk> <unk> to lhasa , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of whom you hear . 6,000 holy monuments that were killed into the rubble of the <unk> .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as the followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was killed in the chinese invasion .
his uncle bug in the diaspora in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked locked up as punishment for the crimes of the crimes .
he was in the age of two , in the prison , in the prison to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live him .
the sister who did this brave thing was brought in a <unk> .
and one day they walked out on an <unk> <unk> , and they had to <unk> for those <unk> for seven years in a heavy camp .
it can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really are in front of a choice . do we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a world &apos;s world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said , before she died , it &apos;s her greatest fear that , as we move towards a thread , <unk> , <unk> worldview , we would have reduced the entire range of human imagination in a <unk> way , but that we &apos;d ever reduce the entire range of human imagination .
and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species might exist for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and at this moment the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and surplus created -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we are in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these <unk> <unk> after human importance , answers with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness , that are aware that all the people and gardens can thrive to be <unk> , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> years in the course of the <unk> of our rule , they were forced to pull in settlements .
this old man refused .
the family that was afraid of his life , he took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the <unk> of their sled was originally made of fish that was made in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or that <unk> storm .
he <unk> out , took his pants out of <unk> and <unk> in his hand , and when the feces started freezing , he formed them into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the sides of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog &apos;s dog , <unk> a different dog , <unk> a different dog and <unk> on the <unk> on the belt of it .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is in many ways , a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all native of the world .
the canadian government gave the full of the complete control of an area that is greater than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new homeland , called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . it &apos;s all <unk> .
this is an amazing example of how a nation , a nation , the <unk> can look for their people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are being part of these children , like the dreams of our own children of hope .
what we &apos;re ultimately trying to at national geographic is that we think politicians never do something .
we think that <unk> -- we think that <unk> is not powerful , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution in storytelling . our site gets 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of trips to places like this to places like this , to places such cultural wonder , that they &apos;re blinded by what &apos;s happening , and hopefully , you &apos;re going to think of one after the other <unk> of anthropology : that this world has made it to contribute in a really multicultural <unk> world that the wisdom of all human well-being can contribute .
thank you .
what i first do first is , as quickly as possible , is the primary work , a new technology that we &apos;ve got microsoft as part of a <unk> a year ago , <unk> , and it &apos;s an environment where you &apos;re either local or a huge amount of visual data .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photographs here that you can <unk> and see <unk> , and pan , in any kind of ways .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one here is a scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in one area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing the power of the system can be like this , is the number of pixel on your screen at every moment , and it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can actually do something like this to actually show that this is a real representation of <unk> and no picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience a real experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technological specs .
and this is really taking these ideas to be able to end these limitations on the available space .
and we hope that this is not a <unk> and different nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
and of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re also going to contribute to this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
<unk> on the <unk> picture nasa .
now let &apos;s get something out now .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> that actually connects two different kinds of technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other one is a very good research on <unk> , who had a noah <unk> , a <unk> at washington university , under the advice of steve <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft &apos;s research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views , where we can penetrate through pictures , and make this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the imagery is actually about meaning .
the <unk> have these images together that they put them together with the real space , in which this footage that all of the <unk> <unk> were made near the canadian <unk> in the canadian <unk> , correspond to this , you see elements of <unk> slides , and those things have been set in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are a lot of <unk> .
i would like to show you one of the <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is from a early prototype project that we &apos;ve been working on in summer for the first time to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is <unk> , and this is not necessarily as obvious as you look at the environments .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral lady who came out with pictures of flickr -- just give them a notre lady in flickr , and they &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> . each of this <unk> cone , which was discovered as this model .
so this is all <unk> , and all of you are in space in this way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to be working at the end of microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the <unk> of professional goods , a pretty large number of them that have been <unk> all in that environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of them are <unk> from faces .
there are a series of photographs here -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame lady that was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of that environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all of the collective memory of what visual earth looks like -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photos are connected , and it creates something that &apos;s larger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the earth .
look at this as the sequel of doing stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s through the complexity that people use it , and the benefit of the user is going to happen to its users .
their own photos will be with metadata <unk> that had another person software .
if someone has done the effort and all of these saints and tells you who they &apos;re all , then my picture of notre <unk> is suddenly <unk> with all of this data , and i can use them as a starting point to dive into this room , and use them as a place of <unk> social experience .
and of course , byproduct all of those are the immense rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just by <unk> or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i get it right ? your software allows for a certain moment , within the next few years , all the images that are in common in the world , are actually using together to connect with each other ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if they want to make it <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the nature of content .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of the <unk> information that many of these images have .
how if you do a <unk> for pictures , where you put sentences in and the text of the website contains a lot of information about it , which is a picture .
but how would it be if this image connected to all your images ?
and then the scope of the <unk> and the abundance of it , it makes it really huge . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book , as i hope , in harmony with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed this .
i want to start with what i call official official .
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official works like this : when our goal is maximizing the good good public good citizens , it &apos;s all about <unk> the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , make sense of the human assumption .
when people have freedom , each one of us is all about doing things that maximize our good good , and no one has to decide for us .
the path to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good you have .
this is , i think , as deep in our water supply , that it would not come in the sense of question .
and it &apos;s also deep in our life .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . this is not big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my grocery store , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy to buy a large number of their own <unk> , in the unlikely case , that none of the 175 in the quiet case .
so that &apos;s like the supermarket .
and then you go to the <unk> store for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , amplifier . and in this one electronics , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can put <unk> million different <unk> facilities from the components that are offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have had every telephone that you wanted to do as long as he came from ma bell .
they rented your telephone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite set of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to get it soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk in the business and to ask that question .
now you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are very much more powerful than buy objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do b or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , i would say , &quot; if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it the patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift from the burden of making decisions about someone knows , is a shift from the burden of making decisions -- and that &apos;s not the best way to make a decision -- and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not in the best constitution .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they care about us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you expect to call out the next morning and ask a change in the prescription .
something like our identity is now a question of choice to show what this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent it .
and we &apos;re very often reinventing ourselves as we want .
that means that every day you wake up at the morning , you need to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and they could get as fast as they could , and then get kids as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
today , it &apos;s easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent of work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married ?
should i get married later ? should i only have children , or a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to do with you and not get a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions .
work -- we are blessed , as carl illustrates , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every place on the planet every minute -- to the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice to make decisions in terms of work , again and again , whether we should be working or not to work .
we can play a football game at football , and we have our mobile phone to a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably probably on our lap .
and also , if they &apos;re all off , every minute in which we ask our child at the <unk> of a <unk> , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly going to be their experience of your child &apos;s <unk> very differently than it was .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world where we were living this way .
and i want to say that there was some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world in which we now live in life .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do something bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
a effect , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of free .
with so many options that you can choose , it &apos;s very difficult to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , a study of investment in volunteers in volunteers .
one colleague of mine had access to <unk> access , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 jobs and about 2,000 jobs .
and what she found was a 10 percent of the employers who took the participation , two percent .
they provide 50 percent less employees -- 10 percent less employees than if it would be five to five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> who are on the face , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to choose to put it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and it &apos;s never coming tomorrow .
do you understand that that &apos;s not just means that people have to eat food , if they don &apos;t go to the retirement because they don &apos;t have enough money to make it , it also means that they miss a lot of <unk> your employers .
it &apos;s not going to be participation , for 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> that would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it really makes the world that looks like this .
they want to make the decision really right when it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want the wrong investment fund , or they don &apos;t want the wrong <unk> .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up less content with the result of the choice , than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is required by the big array of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that <unk> is already perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have a different decision to make , and what happens is these <unk> alternative to the satisfaction that they have made a better decision .
the more options that you have , the easier there is nothing to regret , that &apos;s disappointing for the choice they meet .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has done a big point in this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things about what we &apos;re comparing .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to remember , it &apos;s simply to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that make them full , that makes them less content with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so here &apos;s a couple of in the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they all have it for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spending two weeks from the thought he missed the opportunity , day over day , having a great parking lot .
<unk> are lower the happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we chose .
and the more possibilities of choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take into account into account .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it now , and maybe to do things slowly .
but one of the things that he does is , always who you choose to do for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re doing less powerful .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which it was just jeans , and they had bought them , and they got bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they &apos;ve carried them long enough and often washed enough , they were starting to go .
so , in order to buy new jeans , after many years of the <unk> , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; do you want <unk> , easily <unk> or large ?
do you want to washed buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans to holes ?
you want to cut down the bottom , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and so on .
my jaw down , and after i recovered me , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all those damn jeans <unk> , and i &apos;m going to say the truth -- and i say the truth -- the best appropriate jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i got it better . all of those choices i allowed to have it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain to myself .
the reason i felt worse was , with all these options , my expectations of what a good thing is , was going up for a good than a good thing .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations when they were just in a way .
when you came in 100 ways , damn one of them would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing was compared to what i expected .
it &apos;s adding opportunities to people in the lives of people to increase the expectations of how good are these possibilities .
and this leads to less happiness , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that all used to be better than anything worse than anything that was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to experience experience .
today , in the world where we live -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for you to be hoping to be as well as you expect it .
they &apos;re never pleasant <unk> because your expectations , my expectations are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all got to -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a brief moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> is not always such a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , if there &apos;s just a way to buy that if you &apos;re dissatisfied and you wonder why , who is , you know , the answer is , the answer is , what would you do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and you &apos;re a disappointing one , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you know .
they could have done better .
with 100 different types of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s not a sorry for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re blaming themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointing , because their standards have so high , and then if you have to explain these experiences , think it would be their fault .
and this is the point that we &apos;re better about ourselves , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> , which is one that we all think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choices than some selection .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this period a long time on the choice of our public good .
now , as an <unk> question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as an <unk> question , the thing about thinking about the thinking , which has enabled all these choices in the industrialized societies , that material is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard from many of you whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is they have too little .
so the things i talk about is a curious issue of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is : steve <unk> has told you about those more expensive and hard <unk> car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
you &apos;re worried that we are worse .
if something about what enabled the people of our society to make so decisions to the societies where people have gotten too little set of people , not just to improve people &apos;s lives , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this an <unk> application .
<unk> is worried that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are <unk> .
finally , please read this cartoon , and a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in that <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
and the more i thought about it , the more i got to think of that fish .
because the truth is , if you break it down , it &apos;s all possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break it down , you lower happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost perfect security -- potentially , for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what it might mean , and the discovery of new groups .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology , using new life and building new lives .
we always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and it &apos;s at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different ways to simplify it up to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> , the analog world has been on the digital world of biology .
now try to ask whether we can regenerate , or could we make new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , in mycoplasma <unk> , which is the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something like this .
but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple , compared to our -- trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we look at all these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it actually is the only way in front of this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesizing a chromosome ?
does that really allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules that have never been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but it still has increased , and our last point would be on an exponential curve .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years from the beginning of a medical review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistake .
so we had to develop a new way of developing these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
we made little pieces , and we made a <unk> and a dna molecule about 5,000 letters .
and the exciting stage was when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and we gave it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading genetic code and made viral particles .
when the viral particles were <unk> by the cells , and they came back and killed e. coli .
i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that they could understand this model .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think that this is a situation in which software can actually build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome , and it &apos;s got more than more than <unk> , we thought we &apos;re going to build it at tapes , which we could do with the size of the tapes , which are the scale of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome for the first part in 1995 was a mistake of a mistake in 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes when we used to use the original sequence . if we used to use the original sequence .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and who have to overlap with other <unk> pieces , to build smaller <unk> to make them fit .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose of any of these amino acids .
so we can use genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
first we &apos;ve only signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve been designed to make the pieces so that we could just break them to enzymes with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these <unk> and back together .
and we started building pieces , starting with pieces that had five to <unk> characters , put these together in order to do this together to <unk> this together .
in each step , we &apos;ve created these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them because we were trying to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
when we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 pairs of base pairs -- they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli . it goes beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which uses biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there is an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is simply falling apart .
it was 12 to 24 hours later , everything else has put together again .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space and move , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve been using <unk> using the right design of these pieces , we put them out -- yeast adds up with it .
this is not a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the <unk> .
this is shots over a duration of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are over <unk> letters in <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we print it with a <unk> of 10 and without the distances , it would include <unk> pages just around these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also as simple as you &apos;re in <unk> how we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus , and you get a different inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about about cloning .
in <unk> , the chromosome is the chromosome into the cell , but it &apos;s just recently that we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome at the other , and it can activate it .
we put on the chromosome of a <unk> , roughly speaking , these two as far as people and mice , and we gave some <unk> to destroy the chromosome , and we put it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get a little bit further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we &apos;re finding all sorts of species here on a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , each , thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene has missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes the enzymes that are called the <unk> , actually digest dna .
the chromosome that in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was <unk> in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we just had a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes we put in it .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and <unk> completely in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we go back .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , change things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion where there might be massive <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
we &apos;re doing a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people are on the planet for every single year in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for <unk> billion people .
it will be a challenge for nine .
we need five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of coal , and that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all co2 from this material on the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re in the first line here in the limits of biological reality , and that of our imagination .
we &apos;ve now got technologies today because of these fast <unk> to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the ability to build a big robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you think about these 20 million different genes , or to make these processes to produce <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s only natural selection . we can get to <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a shot of actual <unk> that we &apos;re working on , which you &apos;re actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it will look like . we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
we now focus on fuels of the fourth generation .
now , you &apos;ve seen corn <unk> , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels that are going to be relatively soon , and third generation that are going to be much higher , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is going to increase a huge impact on the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as the material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go out of that path .
and we think we &apos;ll be the first of the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane to use hydrogen as a power source .
we &apos;re exploring if we can use co2 &apos;s co2 that could just be brought to <unk> , the co2 in the fuel in order to power that process .
within a short period of time we believe we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> <unk> industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a <unk> of energy .
but in the same way , we &apos;re working on the same ways that the same approaches to develop vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year on the back , and you have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
and i think that &apos;s going to be changed by using <unk> vaccines in the design system .
this is what the future might look like with changes , today , today is accelerating with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we are light years from it to improve people . our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of those who haven &apos;t been there , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment that has ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a <unk> second in the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s at 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> into detectors .
this is what i do . he &apos;s called a atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas of the atlas of the apparatus that you see the scale .
last year , last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused a huge amount in control control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which is all the way all the way around the lhc , using a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles in the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture of september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was generated by the largest <unk> , or this when someone went to the google side to go and found the front page .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires are <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
now , the engineers among you will look at you and say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that , because when you cut them down very far , they &apos;re called the <unk> .
so at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand that tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets at the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and by the way , the wires , slightly and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is even amazing if you imagine that the magnets that weigh over 20 tons , and it &apos;s moving around 30 inches .
it &apos;s about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to take away whatever we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it out and expect to collect the first data in june or july , and we continue to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way that these accidents , these accidents , once again , has the value of science and <unk> on the limits . it &apos;s easy to reject this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , it forms the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words of a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i guess when he defended the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , was an apprentice was michael <unk> , and this said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind than to assume that our scientific beliefs are that there &apos;s no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect yourself to change .
but the recent thing is a strange thing in my life and my career that has been brought me to my relationship with this work completely .
this strange event was that i had recently written a book recently -- a biography of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , unlike all my previous books , went into the world and a big <unk> , international international organization .
the result is that i &apos;m going to be treated , i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m going to go to extinction .
seriously -- extinction .
so , for example , come up to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that they would never be <unk> ?
don &apos;t you have a fear of all your life and never create a book that &apos;s interested in the world ? never again ?
okay , that really makes courage .
however , it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager , for the first time i told you that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> did not fear , never succeed ?
don &apos;t you worry that the humiliation kill you ?
have you not fear that you &apos;re going to live your life for life , and you &apos;ve never come up with something that you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes for failure ?
like , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had it .
and i &apos;m afraid to do a lot more things that no one would have a clue .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but when it comes to writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i think , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that it should be expected of someone to do that he &apos;s afraid to do the work that he did .
and what about the creative project is going on , that they make us insecure about the other state of state -- in a way , in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist that he was asked to be afraid he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how does it go ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair to be fair -- the group of the chemists don &apos;t get the reputation of <unk> people .
but we seem to be writers in this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but it seems to be the creative of all the <unk> , seem to be this reputation .
all you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds alone in the 20th century , and often died from their own hand .
and even the ones that weren &apos;t actually <unk> , they seemed to be really neglected from their talent .
norman <unk> just said before he was in his last interview , <unk> every one of my books has killed me a little bit more .
a very extraordinary statement that you can do about your <unk> .
but we don &apos;t even make someone like that , if we hear something like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements for so long , and somehow we have the notion of embrace so and collective accepted that creativity and suffering , of course , <unk> creativity and suffering .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel like that ? because only one centimeter away -- i feel not comfortable with this notion .
i find them <unk> .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she &apos;s taken over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we live our great creative practices .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start with this dark path of a guess -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m a career in my career right now .
that means -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s quite likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now writing from the world when the work is being judged by the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here , and it &apos;s probably most likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that can get someone to start to drink nine o &apos;clock in the morning , gin .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seem to be able to do that to continue to write , a kind of <unk> psychological construct has to design .
in some way , i have to find a way of writing a safe distance to the true of me and my very natural <unk> about what &apos;s going to be in the writing .
while i was looking for models last year to do this , i &apos;ve also looked for in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see whether they might have better or more powerful ideas about it than we were able to deal with the emotional risk associated with creativity .
this quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity is coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that was from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity to <unk> demons .
from socrates , he thought he would have a <unk> <unk> that kept him on it from a distance .
the romans had the same idea , we called this kind of <unk> creative mind a <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they thought that a genius , this kind of what was a magical <unk> creature , was that literally in the walls of a <unk> -- it lives literally in the walls of a <unk> -- sort of like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> , the <unk> and the result of work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , it &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that will protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected to certain things , like , like too much , too , too ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at anything for you . everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was <unk> .
that &apos;s how people in the west have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all of the gods , and there &apos;s no room for mystic creatures to embrace the orders of divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and the people began to believe that creativity came completely from its own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who are a genius or what artists call a genius -- instead of being a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a great mistake .
you know ? i think the naked person is that he thinks he or it was like the vessel , like the pelvis and the essence and the source of all of divinity , creative , endless <unk> is a little too much responsibility to have a <unk> , human psyche .
it &apos;s like someone to swallow the sun .
that <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations about success .
i think that this is what that <unk> has wiped out our artists over the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe in a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just jump the <unk> from 500 years from just a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who really sign up in this audience who really sign about the notion of -- basically , <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , and so forth .
i &apos;m not going to take all of you all on this journey .
but the question i want to do is , why not ?
why not thinking about this ?
because it &apos;s just as much sense as anything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s been -- like everyone knows , who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone here -- not always behaves reasonable .
in fact , he can feel really <unk> .
i had a recent encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet poet <unk> stone , who was now about 90 , but she told me that when she was growing up in <unk> virginia , she told me that when she was growing up in <unk> virginia , she said , &quot; she would feel the poem about the landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
the land on it was <unk> .
she felt if it came , because it would get the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could only do it in a moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> running like the devil .
she ran like the devils to the house while she &apos;s been tracked on this poem , and it was just about that she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen , so she had to get it if it could capture through them and catch on it .
they didn &apos;t paint it fast enough , she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get to the house and she gave the poem through she and she missed it , and she missed it , and she missed it . she missed it .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost missed .
so she runs down to the house and looking for the paper and the poem goes through her , and she picks up a pen when it came through she and then -- she said it was like she would grab with her other hand and get it to you .
she caught the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back in her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in those opportunities , the poem was <unk> and intact -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
and when i heard that , i thought that was creepy -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i have to get up every day at the same time and sweating , and sweat , and really awkward <unk> .
but even in my <unk> , i &apos;ve got this thing <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done that .
even i had work or ideas that i can &apos;t identify from a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how do we join in relation to our minds without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves at mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how you can do this , the musician tom <unk> , i had to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist , trying to master these <unk> creative impulses that lived in it and deal with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that one day he went on a freeway in los angeles , and there changed everything for him .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly hear a little patch of a melody , which , in inspiration , is difficult for him to tangible , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s <unk> , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
so he starts to get these old <unk> into him , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be tracked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i can &apos;t do it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he finished the whole thought , and he did something completely new .
he just looked into the sky , and he said , <unk> excuse me , you can &apos;t see that i drive a car ?
<unk> i look like this as i could write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come on at a <unk> moment when i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else is somebody else .
go and make a <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself , which was still as dark as ever as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him was picked up when he took the genius out of it , where he &apos;s caused nothing as anger , and then he <unk> where he came from . he realized that it had to be no <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could give a <unk> , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , physical thing , that was not a lot of tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked , and i &apos;ve rescued it once .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i noticed in one of these specimens in the ocean where we all fall , when we &apos;re working on something , and you start to think it &apos;s a disaster . that &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken to the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i talked my commentary in a empty corner of the room .
i talked loudly , you know , you know , you and i both know when this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i &apos;ve invested in , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up with your share of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to ask to the protocol , i want to ask that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following , and centuries ago , <unk> people have gathered up with <unk> <unk> with sacred dances and music , who were stopped for hours to dawn .
they were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again and again , very rare , something happened , one of the performers , was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;ve all seen a performance in your life .
it was as if time was <unk> and the dancers through a kind of <unk> , he did nothing different than he ever done it before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything he did .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t get more human .
it was bright up by the inside and it &apos;s all <unk> , and it &apos;s all <unk> fire through a <unk> fire .
as something that happened then , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came out , they changed this practice . the pronunciation changed over the course of the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still hear about <unk> and <unk> .
if an artist in spain has something impossible , something magical has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> view of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancers wakes himself up , and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he no longer is a <unk> of god .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe it will never happen to these heights .
and maybe any of god &apos;s name will never be shouting , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspect of their existence come from .
if you may just believe that they are a loan -- from a <unk> source of your life that will be passed on to someone else when they &apos;re ready to do it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think about security in the past months , while i was working on the book that will appear soon -- than the dangerous , frightening , very expected successor to my job success .
what i need to say to myself constantly , when i &apos;m crazy , is not afraid .
not <unk> .
just do your job .
be there to be there , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the <unk> of the genius that you &apos;re asked to do is decide , for a brief moment , a kind of <unk> of wonder to show a wonder , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance , however , your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you , just that you have the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had been the size of the bottom of 48 states , the size of the lower 48 states , in order to shrunk 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press a lot of the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and declining in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> thing in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is called red .
as you can see , it grows on the <unk> , and this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s just in summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
it &apos;s going to be gone from here in 25 years .
this is a problem , because warming around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s large amounts of carbon dioxide in which there &apos;s huge amounts of carbon dioxide , which , when it &apos;s implemented , to methane .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> material in the atmosphere , it could double the amount when we cross this critical period .
already today in a few flat lakes in alaska today , methane is from itself .
professor <unk> in alaska is in alaska with another white lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it <unk> .
and one reason is , this enormous heat warmer greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know , like the sea level , you put it up in the sea , you put them into the sea .
these rivers are taking very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month , scientists reported that the entire continent has now had a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that came up with a couple of <unk> is particularly strong in melt .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the upper lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier &apos;s the <unk> of this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if they &apos;re <unk> , most of the water &apos;s drinking water .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in the sierra environment .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions that you &apos;ve read them are serious .
and this <unk> in the whole world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters in the world have really increased an unprecedented extent to the past .
four times over the last 30 years , like in the <unk> <unk>
this is a totally <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , right , from the american continent west , and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there is a kind of <unk> decline in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , alongside deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the last problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other <unk> .
but we begin to see a change .
here are the ones that were eliminated in the last few years with some green alternatives that were suggested .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar on last <unk> to promote clean charcoal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
for christmas , at the christmas time , in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you saw it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire land of <unk> america of america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the ads of <unk> was for christmas was this .
<unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
it gives us it in skin and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> will be cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me say one very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
and so the alliance has two campaigns called two campaigns .
this is one , part of you .
we see the climate change in the climate change as a serious risk for our business .
and so we put it on the top of the supreme field to spend a significant <unk> on the way to get the truth of coal to the truth .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells though .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s give it quiet .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkably clean <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
look at it right , this is today &apos;s clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these all together is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this <unk> situation .
<unk> america , with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work to make us secure and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america <unk> more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , filthy fuels that are <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to make sure paid for jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far more and fast .
thank you .
i want to start with you to ask you to <unk> your childhood when you were playing <unk> .
while they realized how to reach out the hands , and <unk> the <unk> and moves , they actually learned to think about and to understand the problems of understanding and changing what &apos;s going on .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- combined with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i began to wonder : what if we use computers , i started wonder : what if we could use computers on a flat way , which is , if we could be able to intervene in both hands , which is , if we could use computers ?
and this question was so moving that we decided to explore the answer to the answer and developed <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can be moved with your hand , you can see each other , you can cut your movements , and you have a screen and you have a <unk> .
more importantly , are physically , why you can just reach them out of your hands and access your hands .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation from <unk> of digital data .
and if these tools will be physical and the awareness of their movements and developing them for their movements , you can see each other and see the intricacies of our <unk> with them , we can start with the exploration of new and more entertaining .
i start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for <unk> <unk> , and when i put it in a direction , the video will run forward ; if i put it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other .
so , if i put them next to each other , you get your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and tilt .
so an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like colors such as the color of colors .
in this case , we &apos;ve got three <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color in the middle in the middle , where you &apos;re going to mix .
if we overdo it , we can <unk> a little bit .
there &apos;s also some nice nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast and error and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a series of numbers that i &apos;m making with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of each other at random , <unk> letters , and as you try to form words , this one of these things are tested .
then , after about 30 seconds , there &apos;s been mixed , and you have a new <unk> and a new way to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and put it a video .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is it forms words , and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> there on the bottom right .
and it turned out he wanted the <unk> just to stack up .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the <unk> from the table from the table that this character is .
this is the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the <unk> , and it allows them to interact with the characters .
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today , for that i have time to show it is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as a sound like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can <unk> these notes into the sequence , which you can actually assemble into any patterns .
and you put them together by just putting a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you put it with a certain tone and tends to hire it .
and then , effects like the speed and volume that you use on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to start using the <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , and you can expand this in a row , and you expand a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something drums on this .
and now i connect the filter on the drums so that i can control the effect .
i can speed up the entire sequence by putting the pace of one or another .
and i &apos;ll just hook the <unk> with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s going on .
i don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , but you can improvise to improvise , or shorten them .
and finally , i can <unk> the entire sequence by running the <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which are better to fit on how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way , is that we are at the verge of this new generation from <unk> to the interaction with digital media , which are bringing information into our world that corresponds to our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to you .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i just have to step back to it , and it &apos;s busy <unk> with the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been doing this for a couple of years now , and i &apos;ve just started to know , because i just wanted to know , and i just wanted to make it even even more , what i learned in studying theory .
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was an curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like this .
and i think that most of biology in general , which is generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important , and even more , much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like all these genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
there are now craig venter in the <unk> trying to make <unk> , which is a algae .
now , there are things that are totally out of the ground in the everyday life , which is what most people are not aware of , for example , that allow us to wash up with 40 degrees , they &apos;re actually genetically <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue on endlessly .
and so from the interest in this technology , i just continued to move on to it .
so what &apos;s going on ?
most people know that most people know it from the <unk> .
and then it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and then it &apos;s always like this , you know , the hackers break out somewhere and claws and so forth .
it &apos;s kind of sad for the <unk> very sad , because it &apos;s not true of what it actually has started , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , and it can just be a <unk> thing , which you can simplify a question , and how can you make it better , and how can you make it better .
and it just got it up with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole bit of <unk> that we do with <unk> all kinds of stuff .
and now , even to biology , and this is what i want to do is this metaphor , which comes from synthetic biology , is that biology is actually a <unk> , because it &apos;s a matter of the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic , it &apos;s not just like computers , and not only <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it &apos;s also a code that you can program and so you can actually <unk> it , so , and i found myself incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
now , this has actually been adopted eight really , eight really , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe , and with an cooperation in india in india , but now members of people have on the world .
that &apos;s a more artistic direction , so that &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers and working together with scientists that are working with these technologies and to ask these technologies , there are <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to find such a way to have an playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is a network of <unk> a network , which is actually more like a forum , where you &apos;re standing and we &apos;re discussing online .
they &apos;re a little technical set and a little technical set , and they &apos;re going to get a little bit like that , so that &apos;s what they &apos;re asked .
and based on these networks that made the whole popular popular , we &apos;ve developed a scene that i &apos;d like to take a little bit about .
here &apos;s the image on the top on the top on the top , this is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , a private school , non-profit institution , where everyone can .
kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just go through it , and they &apos;ve set up a lab and look at what can you do when these <unk> are .
there &apos;s a group at the left on the left is a group in indonesia , which is called <unk> , but there &apos;s been pretty long .
even longer than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also looking at an artistic aspect of the kind of biological materials , and , yes , <unk> , and combine that in a pretty <unk> way .
a group of ankara , which i &apos;ve met a long time ago , which is a <unk> that would like to give you more to the public , what they learn in school , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what <unk> is .
and i got up on the top of the other image in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in <unk> with an exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s really a very young people , but the only thing that all of the united states actually is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with it , and what you can do with it , and to say , and to ask , and to ask , you know , okay , what do you want to join you , you have your interest to engage you with this ?
so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you need some material .
you need of course biological materials , and you need to take tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you normally understand under a lab , they &apos;re sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , only for <unk> , trained academics with <unk> and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every one of each <unk> has actually evolved higher technology than most <unk> , which is really like this .
and the premise of that premise with that premise that has been trying to do with that premise , for example , brian <unk> in england , has a <unk> <unk> , then you took a <unk> , a <unk> , and , yes , so it &apos;s going to bred bacteria .
so everyone , which is a soup that he &apos;s left too long , has left too long .
and i tried to try and go a little bit in my lab , a little bit , and then i got to put on this on the ebay and put a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to do a <unk> , so <unk> <unk> , so <unk> .
now that &apos;s not really a joke .
down here in the picture , you see the lab , in <unk> , so this is such a <unk> garage with all this kind of <unk> garage in paris , a group in paris , which has been setting up in the university , a group in paris , which is what has been setting up and doing pretty much interesting things .
and this is <unk> , which is the one that &apos;s also mentioned <unk> , this one , that kind of <unk> in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you can see it &apos;s relatively relative , so that there are people who are doing it alone , all the way back to big organizations , so far , more <unk> , even more <unk> .
but always the way the approach is that it &apos;s supposed to be simple and accessible .
the first project we did as an international group , when we were really aware of our self , <unk> , there &apos;s now a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re now familiar with people who are talking and right .
and then came from the <unk> <unk> website of the founder , and he said , well , we also have to be able to make it real , and then i &apos;ve got two events in london , one in london , <unk> 10 , and short on the <unk> , in san francisco .
and , so , that &apos;s what it was about , yes , <unk> , who are we like , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values , and what are our goals , our foundations ?
and then we have a <unk> <unk> .
and that was quite intuitive , so everybody just has his wishes , his and what , you know , put it , put it , say , then .
there came up , i think , a very good code .
and then we don &apos;t make it compulsory , but that &apos;s like , i think , i think , it &apos;s pretty good , people are right there .
and we even tried to do that in the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re in terms of <unk> , even one step further than the academic world .
yeah , what do we do this right now ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland itself was that we were called an optical case or optical event .
that &apos;s when you focus a laser beam in the room , then you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid and then moving in that focus , so that &apos;s been captured there , so it &apos;s captured there , so it &apos;s in the principle .
and this really works , that &apos;s done in the academic <unk> , and we &apos;ve thought , <unk> , we might get it too , then we took a webcam , the lens <unk> , the lens , you have a microscope that increases around .
you can see that down there .
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then the laser <unk> the laser , and then trying to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we still have learned a lot about this .
so another project that came out of the french group in paris , and that &apos;s worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s like , you know , one of the things that &apos;s like a <unk> , so <unk> or something , so he &apos;s engaged with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this helmet in there , and in the cooperation of the museum , it &apos;s walked .
and then the visitor in the room could go in the room , sit on this chair , sit this helmet .
and then their brainwaves were measured and depending on what they were thinking , or as they thought , it &apos;s all kinds of lights in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which has to do with this <unk> is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes to reproduce , to reproduce , reproduce , to reproduce so that you can see it visible .
so , if i do that , you know , the <unk> at the crime scene , then you go , collect any <unk> , and then they turn this up , and then you can turn this up , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this person .
and the machines that do something like this , they &apos;re pretty expensive that you buy , the least they buy , the cheapest , <unk> .
and this is not in <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of many you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got such two two builders and i said , <unk> , that we do simpler and cheaper , and then they just get out of open source , <unk> , this one of the device , and then they &apos;re actually brought to <unk> , and now the cheapest vendor of these devices .
i think some kind of six hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project that i started in recently was to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is something like that , two centimeters or something .
you use <unk> <unk> , and then they put them into these <unk> , and then i got the <unk> , and then i &apos;ve got it <unk> and then put it like this .
so the device that you can see is not working .
but this is so my prototype that looked pretty low , but it has looked like this on a branch , put it on it , put electronics on it , and that was the pressure , and that was the pressure .
and then i took a <unk> and put it together .
a <unk> , if you have the full power of water , has enough pressure , so i think 40 to <unk> bar on it .
and so , then you can accelerate the particles very , and then you can go in the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euro or something like that , <unk> to 50 .
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially feasible .
so , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , right now , the <unk> of the scene just to increase the availability of technology , and also increase the information and the <unk> that more people can get involved .
because , as at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a relatively little idea of it and also a chance to really make themselves well .
because if you read about it , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or seen it yourself .
and i think technology is increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make good decisions in society , you want to meet good decisions in society and you want to join , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> then <unk> under the <unk> open and citizen science .
so , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get into a position with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least <unk> on the website , <unk> website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that you &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people in there than actually exist .
so i know some who don &apos;t have .
and that &apos;s just the <unk> , the individual people .
in part , with these <unk> , these places .
and that &apos;s really at the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has only started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> that have become all over the world .
and , of course , we &apos;re hoping that we &apos;re also similar to even more and more and more closely connected , so that even stop getting involved .
and i would invite everyone to deal with it and even try what to try .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get there too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we work ?
this is a question that i &apos;m really moved to as designer , but also in the field of <unk> , and in front of all things in the field of <unk> .
and it &apos;s about how to deal with people in interactive media , so they can use these interactive media , and create a very <unk> experience .
because i think the interactive media in us is that cognitive models , cognitive models , and so the paradigm that have been <unk> in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we just have just been <unk> by interactive media .
and it &apos;s very amazing , because you actually think that this <unk> that you &apos;ve seen is that it &apos;s actually going to be in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s that the future is right with us , at our <unk> roots .
now , what are actually <unk> models ?
i took four pieces of paper down , and i &apos;d like to explain it to a moment .
to <unk> cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve seen in the field , so .
i heard these <unk> models that we have basically a natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds basically just unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go into the same time , and i &apos;m going to show you by trying to prove that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to talk about these <unk> models in the situation very , really , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area , which explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is <unk> by definition , which includes the denial of linearity , and what of course tells us is that we feel linearity as normal .
the fourth thing is that history is a place for us .
now , what about virtuality is now with virtuality which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to show you that .
how many doors has the house in which you live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
you go through the spirit of this house , in <unk> , you live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it <unk> the reality , with no computers .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to spend the virtual reality of the way to do virtual reality in our <unk> , so we can actually do it all the time .
and this is the wealth that the virtual fortune to <unk> the reality , which people have also needed to do in the two times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in this mind , it played off .
in this head , <unk> , and with these virtual pictures , the imagination , we &apos;ve just been passed on .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality with virtuality .
the interesting thing is , if i get a little trip to it .
yes , that &apos;s going .
and the interesting thing about this is that at this time of the human time , it was <unk> and medium .
if you &apos;re a little bit further thinking .
what are media today ?
you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i get to talk about that .
the central tools of <unk> has been stories for previously stories .
<unk> , priests , <unk> , they were <unk> for it to preserve knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong at stories today .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we &apos;ve still <unk> <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a child that &apos;s reaching for the most of the <unk> for most of the time of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love of story depends on us as a child on our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this is a lot further back , in the cultures &apos; cultures .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , it &apos;s a particularly amazing thing that we have <unk> <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think about it .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the north american tribe in <unk> .
and life lived in the british british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you &apos;d somehow navigate , somehow , from island to island to get food .
and they &apos;ve done this with what we call this <unk> .
you may also know , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have any <unk> , but they use the <unk> <unk> or also <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation could be mapped about navigation and topography of regions of songs .
which was the language of <unk> rang .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sounds and about rhythm .
and these sounds , and the geology , which shows the topography of the region , and that has also enabled , of course , that you could <unk> these songs and sit together , and on the left , to the right , and to move back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
it &apos;s going to happen so <unk> machine .
we &apos;ve done this before what is called <unk> .
so , the machine age is , and what happened is the book , and it &apos;s happening is the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening is that we have the responsibility for our memories , and the <unk> of our individual changes in its external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have <unk> <unk> a piece of <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly being alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known <unk> on the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass media , he means the book and the picture , so not television , so on tv , and so on , the internet and so on , what we &apos;ve been <unk> in as a mass media , and our ability to <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
the <unk> for the age age .
what does our thinking about our thinking and on our <unk> ?
and then , the most powerful thing that we might have is to say .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> in the course of the <unk> of <unk> .
that is , instead of being individually , we have standardized , widespread , <unk> patterns of memories that we can hang out of our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing that we don &apos;t work in pictures things are not in pictures , but we &apos;re <unk> them .
we have used to that things happen to happen .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as the law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re <unk> as a <unk> very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had this machine machine , and we &apos;re going to go to the so-called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> that will bring us back to this opportunity again to discover our skills .
it &apos;s about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i just want to explain it for a minute .
there &apos;s technical concepts like this , for example , the augmented reality , which is called the extended reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , for example , then you &apos;re looking at a concept that &apos;s going to combine the virtual world with the real world , which means our <unk> to the <unk> , which is virtual , which is virtual , is addressed again .
another example is called virtual reality .
so , of course , as crazy of course , in my talk , we &apos;re moving forward to not <unk> , virtual worlds , the model of <unk> .
and others are another example , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all of that needs the ability , our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated in conclusion , and i hope that the video works , a very , very nice project with me , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are here today .
you might just get up for a minute , so you can get up with the one that you &apos;re going to talk about .
and this project , i &apos;ve got , as an example , brought back to this particular project , with cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say to that .
which , of course , extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a game game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;re very likely to see that any people who are doing some <unk> people , or they &apos;re playing with some <unk> in your hand .
anyway , they &apos;re going to do that .
this is a game for the outside .
and this is true that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects to the virtual world , which is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize to me that i need to be so strong .
you can tell you a lot better than that , there &apos;s more much more than that .
and that &apos;s why i discover a city by looking at what &apos;s going to be positive or negative .
and so i get a very different vision of the city , a completely different impression , which i &apos;m seeing negative and positive zones of a city , and it &apos;s also a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we &apos;d like to look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , excuse me , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , right .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this my talk , and in the sense that the characteristics and the skills that we have acquired from the <unk> <unk> and the skills that we have acquired a little bit of <unk> on the age of this , and that we have a little bit of a <unk> at age that are going to be activated by what we call <unk> <unk> .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be able to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked whether this bag is a <unk> bag and going to talk to me .
it &apos;s not going to be done .
i &apos;m also going to go back in the same way that &apos;s there .
but i &apos;m just going to do it yet , and i &apos;ll just be curious .
yes , kids are from nature from <unk> or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a <unk> of house , so , of course , i &apos;m also changing with the issue of curiosity , and how the curiosity changes our thinking , and why do we get curiosity , and we need to get curiosity and so forth , and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with a real way of mind as a creator .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to <unk> in such n .
and that &apos;s also what i had last half a year .
a <unk> to the subject of natural design design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why all the designers start with this kind of natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and that &apos;s where i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up , because things should always be more intuitive , more natural , <unk> , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us people , of course , which is <unk> or intuitively .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve got into the realm of natural design of design , so the next generation in the human computer in the relationship of the human computer is dealing with how our tools , or how the computer is changing from computers to digital assistants .
so i &apos;m busy doing this , when , of course , or intuitively .
maybe you have to look at it again again .
why does that happen ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , this is just shown here , and then we &apos;re moving now from the third <unk> , or <unk> .
so , from the modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , <unk> through the language .
that means that you &apos;ve found a common language to communicate , you could communicate with each other , or , in other areas , cities have created cities or villages , and it creates <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very living .
you had to learn , so not a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it and of course , of course .
so that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do through the ancient society and the first shape of abstraction .
and that was a <unk> , of course , because , of course , the living language began to be <unk> in the form of writing , which is what <unk> and alive is , let me start and <unk> it in stone , and it <unk> me .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s of course a very different narrative than if it &apos;s a living way of living .
but <unk> then , then <unk> , was given this script as a <unk> .
then the next generation that we &apos;re actually actually living in today .
this is the <unk> and <unk> <unk> type of writing with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was the same thing that <unk> , <unk> and others , are you actually crazy when the people start to read , then they want to go back , and that &apos;s , of course , <unk> .
and now we come to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , this is the only one of a few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually actually in this <unk> stage in this point that we &apos;re doing this .
of course , the confused of us , because we see the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
so , with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking against , don &apos;t say that in <unk> <unk> and no beef , i want to just <unk> the other phenomena , and i want to do that at all .
and these two worlds , we just bubble together , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is , if you look at this new society , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> , lots of mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but it &apos;s not a local level , but on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme ecology is a global global .
not if i think you see local <unk> , and the neighbor &apos;s going to think less ecologically , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village , there was actually a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , as well as the total transparency .
in the time in the village , you know who , who , who , and when , so this is what happens today about this extension of our self through these mobile devices on a global level .
if it was that we know global and faster and more and better .
this was what happened before the village before .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been busy looking at what &apos;s called , because , of course , what &apos;s of us , of course , what do we have too <unk> , what &apos;s the difference for us , but what does the difference ?
because often people get people , they can &apos;t make it <unk> so that everybody can do with it .
so you have to look at what &apos;s called , because it &apos;s not just changing it , it &apos;s to be different , it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and when of course , of course , is intuitive , and how can i take an impact on it , and the way i think about things like this is that they &apos;re the <unk> , so they &apos;re very intuitive , because they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re just fun .
you &apos;re also busy , as well as a student , with the issue of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s also what you start , of course , where you start and watch and watch and say , okay , i just look at the inner self .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we work when we <unk> ?
and what does actually mean , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of the perception and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs said you <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it <unk> it .
so you really have to look at in detail if i want to make some <unk> or intuitively <unk> , which means that &apos;s in the core .
and you can see , you know , you have a our seven senses , most of the thinking we think about five , it &apos;s actually seven <unk> , in fact , in the near future , it certainly makes sense , and as an extension , again .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say alone , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of the use of the word , don &apos;t know what it means as en detail .
but i have to understand at the core , to understand when it gets information to information , when the data gets information from data and information , that i know how to do things as well as well , or of course , of course .
and of course , how design influence on perception .
and we see this , when i do things , i can make it confusing to them like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make it sort of intuitive design by showing things .
so much more natural , in a vessel in a vessel , but i look directly at where is salt and pepper .
and if i say to someone , give me salt or pepper , then it will be thinking about the right thing , where is it in it .
and then on the left , <unk> access , and then i hope that no sugar is in there , the salt is just giving .
but also , our perception itself , how does it fool us .
for example , that perception .
and the right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same as big , and yet our perception is changing , depending on what context we do things .
anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should still work .
it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle begins to relate to some resemblance or associate .
and if i go to a <unk> , then we don &apos;t just look at one unit , that &apos;s circle , circle , and yet we see one unit , we don &apos;t see anymore , a circle , a circle , a circle .
it &apos;s called <unk> or <unk> , which is also influenced us in perception .
so important to the designers that are most of the most semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> of the continuity near the continuity and so on .
in fact , in the third , they &apos;ve forgotten .
but this is essential to a essential part , if you just want to design things as well as intuitively as well .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting about vision .
it sounds very banal first , but it &apos;s really exciting to me when you &apos;re closer to it .
so we &apos;ve got the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back of the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re looking at it from the back .
and that &apos;s an assumption , in front of the front , that you see something you see , <unk> circle .
that is , we &apos;re not going to see what we &apos;re looking at before we see it again in the back of our <unk> , to say , to say , okay , ok .
i have such a cognitive cap here , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and then that &apos;s also there , then it &apos;s coming back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back is not the back of the front and says , right now , i &apos;m going to go back and make sure if what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually seen .
so , there &apos;s a very , very <unk> process of doing things , and in which these things happen to happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
now everyone &apos;s trying to see something about this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who you see .
anybody sees something a specific thing ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw this , that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know that .
they &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , you &apos;ve always seen it .
that means , i &apos;ve actually talked about them in the way that you don &apos;t see any patterns of any pattern , but i have it <unk> in a very short time , again , to see this dog in this <unk> picture .
and this is this projection of vision , <unk> .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m looking forward , i &apos;m looking at the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , yes , gray , you don &apos;t actually have it , but here in this kind of <unk> mass that &apos;s going on .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i sort of like , in the present way to the present , i can also bridge a very well to bridge that i &apos;m looking at with three seconds .
it has to process that as a present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegantly <unk> for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it also is an interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
that means <unk> , if you know that now , look at who you look like a long time , because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what you just can do with .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the <unk> period that we have .
that means that this first idea happens in a fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things also , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think of it accordingly .
and , of course , designers are not just looking at the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but of course , with the subject of <unk> .
so , how a human being goes around with certain things .
so there &apos;s some kind of stuff that is practical , so things like this is so vulnerable to things .
there &apos;s <unk> where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there &apos;s some symbolic functions , why there &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , which is a little bit of <unk> , which is not a little <unk> , so <unk> <unk> on money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
we &apos;re more like the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we think about , of course , a creator .
back to my actual subject , natural user interface and the theme of which , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> is always , how can i be able to get a certain target at a certain destination , or how to make a human person in a certain way , as a person , in a certain way , is to achieve efficient and <unk> .
it &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i do something like this ?
can i be able to use that directly , or do i need n , or i need the training of the training of this .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
i &apos;m just making it different and make a beautiful thing , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , in the software that we &apos;ve just seen , you &apos;re going to be able to understand why <unk> percent of our current software is very intuitive or not to use , which is <unk> in many areas or <unk> that is more intuitive as a classic software .
but it &apos;s not been an intuitive <unk> for apple to make a look at a fundamental <unk> material , so if i just want to harness technology devices .
why ?
because , in fact , through this new kind of <unk> , the natural user is <unk> , for example , five times faster than the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you take some of the classic <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software that &apos;s just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re going to probably go home four hours more likely to go home , but your employers , or anybody , you know how to do it with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s of course , of course , for us , of course , one of the things that are <unk> , also to make things .
and then if we went back to the field of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> <unk> interfaces that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that already came with is a <unk> model or mental model like the software <unk> , they &apos;ve been working , because you have an idea of something called the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computers .
so , not more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
that made all of this a lot , but it also goes much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works a lot more with behavior .
so this is what i think , as a <unk> , a lot more likely to behave than this .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
i think it &apos;s always going to look for the success , that it &apos;s going to be a app for success .
and if i take a step into this natural interfaces into this natural user interface , where i have a voice , by language , by language , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , and <unk> things , then i &apos;m still faster and still left .
but that leads me again to the point when things are actually more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re going to be more intuitive , and then i have to get back to my little friend here and see , and look , what does this mean from view of the <unk> , when is now something too intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always a little intuitive for us , if i have to think very little about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s simply making it easy .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
so , if we look at that we can use existing <unk> from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use it as a creator .
that is , i can be able to transfer that an intuitive , human <unk> on a software , and make the software a lot of stuff .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s actually the <unk> <unk> of us people , and now i &apos;ve already told it .
this is called <unk> .
that &apos;s the use of each of us and <unk> is an acronym , and it &apos;s for orient , <unk> , inform , <unk> .
that &apos;s what everybody does all of you all the time , but he makes it unconsciously , or indeed , instinctively , or instinctively .
the model is already <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used all of us , without most of all , that we &apos;ve been using this model .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to 50 to <unk> times of activity , so in your sleep , you found that it &apos;s often less <unk> than a day .
now , i can now get rid of this mental <unk> , <unk> , inform , <unk> , <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of <unk> , but now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a greater grail of <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i go to this now , for example , in which i &apos;m orient as a <unk> , <unk> as a choice , you find it up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , i can look at it somewhere , and yes , i can send it a little bit or buy it , or so on .
then i can transfer this whole .
i &apos;m trying to do that by a <unk> .
that &apos;s what everybody was eating cake .
in fact , i interact with the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview of this , and i can go to this , and say , show me all the thing with chocolate for you .
and there &apos;s one interface at once , which is a lot more intuitive and very much natural .
because , that i can reach the things like that , and you can come to me , is essential to me , is essential more natural than if you &apos;re talking about <unk> organized web websites or other mechanisms to be able to make these things accessible .
imagination is <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to end up as well , to say , a and again again , also designers have to think differently , and in that sense , thank you very much , and so thank you so much for your attention , and so much .
i want to leverage you to a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing you &apos;re going to do as a child , as a baby , is that you care about what <unk> you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the classroom , and , of course , will , of course , your curiosity , of course .
and curiosity can &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why everyone who &apos;s here are and curious , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to do it now , basically , this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in the quality .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
so every day , you give + scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be able to do as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t do phosphorus and make phosphorus .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we have something that we &apos;re talking about here with something , which would be <unk> , but it &apos;s not like that .
because they all talk about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
now , we have phosphorus , and already , through the <unk> world , we &apos;ve taken much more uranium into the environment than it &apos;s used in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years alone , <unk> tons of uranium in our fields have been distributed in germany .
and we take it all up .
it &apos;s <unk> leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less garbage .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i say , <unk> your child , <unk> it just three times rather than five .
that &apos;s just a bit less destruction .
if we think about that from <unk> to the <unk> , then our entire earth is going to be used to be used to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s just about thinking about the <unk> of <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground .
in the ground , over 60 percent is saved .
and at the moment , we &apos;re going to build corn and you &apos;re going to lose corn pounds of 30 tons per hectare per hectare , or also <unk> .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than <unk> .
so , of course , we can look at the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or content .
in <unk> , for example , in <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and because we get older , they &apos;re going to get the <unk> bigger .
that &apos;s all they are in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby takes about six thousand <unk> .
we could , of course , to reduce 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we do with this <unk> ?
one of the things that men are not a pigs to do .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted in the pigs over the <unk> constituents .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is <unk> , right ?
traditionally , we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you get the people who exist when you say that , they &apos;re better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , they become <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> than the human population .
in israel , if you make a human living , you &apos;re <unk> the earth .
here it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants are about four times more than us people .
i could also take termites with me , but in the united states nobody likes to see in the united states , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that ants weigh much more than us .
and because they &apos;re physically working a lot harder than we do , and because it &apos;s just three to six months , they are equivalent to your weight , in your weight , there &apos;s something more 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re stupid , yes ?
and where you can see how far we &apos;re going to be able to do what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , a program has a program , to 20 40 40 40 , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be dumber than the trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
thankfully not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
there &apos;s still six billion trees alone there .
now , did you have heard about <unk> of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than the trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , <unk> <unk> , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> back .
every year we &apos;re losing phosphorus so three million tons of phosphorus that would really have to go back .
and it &apos;s too many .
on it .
that means we feel so guilty on the earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they &apos;re all saying that our own <unk> will go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
it &apos;s too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to being less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest thing not to be there , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> if you &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot now , they would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can regain our nutrients .
we do it in brazil , where we get the nutrients back .
right , we can <unk> nutrients in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , where we &apos;re going to take directly the waste .
in china , one of the <unk> today is a <unk> today , sort of , yes ?
and in our western world we were getting too stupid , our nutrients .
and that means that all of the western <unk> came out of that the city has always taken , but the farmers never returned .
by doing this , the cities are growing more , because the farmers went into the cities , and the cities would keep moving away their nutrients .
all of all the western empires are expanding , until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to have <unk> civilization over five thousand years because you were always able to get the nutrients .
even today , if you were invited to eat in china , you would expect to eat it as long as they go to the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat them , not to <unk> them .
that means you can see on the internet , you can see the nutrients .
it &apos;s really nice about that , if you do that , so agriculture is making biogas , on a hectare of land with five thousand people in favelas , so a farmer can make about <unk> dollars , and they &apos;re waiting for a farmer to get around and grow and <unk> and vegetables .
and the great thing about this is that the oil companies go in the favelas by over <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , to be pretty little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s <unk> , of course , but the plants are themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that a farmer can easily manage .
that &apos;s called the <unk> .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been <unk> .
they could just make a liter of <unk> <unk> , and then it would be ruined over years .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that is , we don &apos;t have to control people , to be pretty little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what we want to do is write up , in germany , the best <unk> of all wastewater treatment is in <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> .
because the <unk> device could best get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s happening .
we &apos;ve spent over three years now in holland .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is what phosphorus is .
but we need the overall problem .
you know , there are two countries control , almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there is opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of the <unk> control .
and the oil is going to replace us by other energy fuel .
but you can &apos;t replace phosphorus .
this is not about making the existing one slightly less , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask first , what &apos;s the right thing .
that &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
now in holland that &apos;s easier , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine , for example , your wife is sad if you &apos;ve got them off , and you come to 50 roses .
completely inefficient .
but really effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eat about six <unk> three pounds during your life .
here .
this is not a scientific reason not exactly right because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to do .
but a <unk> , even with this illumination , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but really effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not about resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
not that you &apos;re going to burn a little bit better , to burn it a little bit better and lose it and lose all the materials for loops , but first to ask , how do you include loops ?
just imagine mozart .
yes ?
if i go to dinner and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , <unk> ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you put yourself in love , efficiently ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters , it &apos;s not about saving , to reduce .
all the <unk> .
we say to people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just out of the right , right ?
in any point where you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re going to get <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in the way we think north .
there is every footprint .
if you walk , yes , every footprint on the ground .
because the soil is going to die from the mosses , and the wind , and the water , washing up the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint that the water remains the water longer .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so , not saving , not to avoid .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you can see in italy , like people in italy , like , in the <unk> of the car , come out of the car .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> movement that &apos;s an fluid that &apos;s a liquid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re moving everywhere .
and it contains seeds from rare plants so that they contribute to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two loops .
not everything should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using them , they don &apos;t use them .
it &apos;s just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , which must be that they have to be in biological systems .
the things that are going to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
at all direct ads , not for the company <unk> per se , but that you now help this business to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
yes ?
so , when i go to the food and say , this is free of <unk> , then you don &apos;t help you .
no , we put on what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
aren &apos;t toxic in there .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes in which you can <unk> the <unk> at the <unk> and the <unk> in biological loops , right ?
all of it is <unk> .
and if we can do it , of course , for nike , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the <unk> worldwide that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re asking , ask for people .
hey , <unk> , do you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve already changed the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really <unk> .
so , help me get a little bit about this .
but it goes .
yeah .
this is what just been shown .
that goes .
we can do things like that now that if they &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can have biological loops .
the technical cycles are in the same way .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s done to go back into the cycle .
so also , in any store , you can <unk> things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
if the waste is right now .
everywhere , this <unk> <unk> .
in the countries where people come to money .
but there &apos;s on the <unk> front , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we &apos;re changing the climate change , you can just go back to <unk> , then you can go back with a baby in israel or in tunisia , or in tunisia .
yes ?
just if you take these these <unk> , you know , sterilized and the powder to plant trees .
and that &apos;s the baby <unk> for the entire life , already at the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , so .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can do everything again .
i started to have an institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working with , and you can all be engaged .
there &apos;s extra club to be <unk> , where everyone can join .
so , not to save , not to prevent , avoid , avoid , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
you do that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that i was a <unk> , which is to me as <unk> , which is in the english <unk> .
<unk> are the written grades of the written grades in <unk> music .
that as a translator , you &apos;re not just <unk> the word of the text into a different language , but also to understand the deeper sense of words and <unk> to make it a useful translation , everyone knows it with <unk> .
from germans to english , you can take more knowledge because when you go to poetry or even about poetry or even about poetry .
it &apos;s kind of alien to <unk> , which is what we &apos;re doing with a musician .
i &apos;m just having the written grades as a <unk> .
you think that the composer in the notes has exactly <unk> everything he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are roughly the same right or <unk> , like a verbal , if also <unk> <unk> sharp , description of a landscape .
because in that <unk> <unk> , the smell of the flowers don &apos;t have to smell the degree of the <unk> , just to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel it .
that means , the interpreter has to be able to figure out these <unk> data on another , which is <unk> , concrete , non-verbal <unk> .
today , i want to tell you what else i could translate otherwise , so <unk> , even into a verbal language .
it &apos;s basically a translation of the translation .
so i prefer to do it all in german , because if i had to translate into english , it would be equivalent to me with translation of the translation of the translation .
so the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a writing .
so , it &apos;s not going to take notes reading the keys on the piano or the right place on the piano or the right place on the piano .
because these were just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of letters you realize when you can do the language .
so , you need to take the learning process of music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you &apos;re learning it for the <unk> , just passively understand or you can also talk to action , to the musical speakers .
and the work of the <unk> begins like a <unk> .
after all you &apos;ve chosen a piece , you &apos;ve chosen a play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re all going to be excited about the origin of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read about the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from composers .
you study the works that he created before and after .
you include comparison .
the <unk> , writing it .
what was he felt ?
how were the circumstances of the society and politics ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
you think in that time , by looking at contemporary images or the literature .
and over time , you &apos;ve also got a rich knowledge of the role of the composers that will play more often , and it &apos;s easier to get yourself and feeling in it .
the composer is getting more to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more and more to my personal cause to play it .
now , since the notes of everything else is an accurate record of the cause of the composer , but only a framework , i &apos;m now turning this framework to make sense of it again and meaning .
and i say , in my own words , what might be written between this framework .
i play <unk> what these sounds might have .
now for the composers , and for the composers , what they might mean for him today .
each sound , every phrase gets to make sense of it , because i feel it even , because it comes out of <unk> .
it has to be <unk> for me , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience , that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert again , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing so long in advance .
you know , as you have a happy new day again , even though , with the same rituals of life , getting up , breakfast , their breakfast , i &apos;ll get the same thing over and over again .
i &apos;ve become a day older again to change seasons , my pulse goes down at night than the morning , and it takes a longer longer that the sound takes back back as home .
i take the audience to breathe true , consciously or unconscious .
all that affects me , and all of this affects my experience with composition .
it &apos;s a wonderful thing , if i &apos;m standing on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and she &apos;s going to answer that answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have <unk> and whatever you can do .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and they have seen them as the audience , what the music communicates .
this is a different concert .
i will never play that way , like that moment .
i can &apos;t play as play as in 20 years .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have much more <unk> about emotions and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have a new <unk> .
have a nice concrete example of this .
it was on a <unk> <unk> teacher at my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> <unk> , <unk> and long professor of the <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young so that he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune to meet him , was very early on , to meet in my high school , and i was in high school .
i was 17 at this time 17 , when i went back in one of his courses , and the last one of four ballads by chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was .
this is such a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
he <unk> and said , so ?
this must be <unk> .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was over <unk> .
well , with 17 , you still have dreams , but not meaningful memories .
and i &apos;ll play this piece , every couple of years , and it always has changed for me , even though it has not changed .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
an example of this is a very different area . prints , the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s all the same garden , with <unk> light .
it &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as she saw in that moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the most profound interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now i &apos;ve been older than the chopin with <unk> years when he wrote the piece .
he lived only <unk> years .
and i think it &apos;s important to me again in the notes , even if i mean , you can memorize them .
to hold <unk> , directly with composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
most of all , if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to take about the word for spoken language .
so often , the <unk> is so that you just learn reading the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning to read that before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the sound on the notes on the instrument .
and if all of the fingers in time , and just like it &apos;s moving in the notes , then come out of sound that sound like music .
when that happens , the student gets the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s hardly spoken in the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> in the front , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
but also , if you put these data out , it still remains a little technical .
and yet it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something <unk> .
because that , to make music on the instrument , to do your musical conversation and feel there before .
which is the singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn to sing , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents &apos; parents , it &apos;s not going to be done by itself .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experiences and idea of music , and then you have another possibility , so it &apos;s about an instrument , to make sound .
people who have never been singing , so have never felt directly with your body as it is to form a clay .
it &apos;s a phrase with his breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
we were to sing our vocal chords , our hands and feet to the dance .
that &apos;s how the <unk> are the sequel of my finger .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make any longer music when it gets bored .
no need to be whistling or singing a <unk> .
every single music is going to be <unk> , if you &apos;re constantly <unk> from the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i didn &apos;t sing ?
the question i do , can &apos;t sing , a because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to figure out , if you can &apos;t do it , or learn how to put these little muscles that hire the vocal chords , just using the vocal chords .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it <unk> that they &apos;re <unk> .
and i wonder how <unk> competent was this diagnosis ?
do you have a <unk> or <unk> , how do you say beautiful today ?
or d , they don &apos;t like a music , and they want to have nothing to do with nothing .
and then what i would think about , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also do it again .
well , you know , you can see , no one has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t please say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , but i &apos;m sure you can tell whether they like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t get rid of food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them , and tell them whether it tastes you or not .
whether the music is to <unk> or too sweet .
say what they feel .
and over time , they also get standards , and they want to make something like a spices of spices , or taste even <unk> .
why do i do from my audience now that can also listen to action ?
because the music is a language and a language to communicate it .
a piece of art that you never look at has no power .
the food that was cooked in a chef or a chef loving a <unk> , and not just looked at recipes .
so , please listen when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment where the adults make active music or at least active music , a child grows up , it &apos;s easy for a <unk> , to ask , which color is your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child is playing , after a <unk> , rather than a red flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
so that was the very first beginning of a musical term .
so the first step of interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written by a hundred , <unk> or even three hundred years ago ?
so the instruments have been <unk> .
there wasn &apos;t a <unk> at all over the time .
it was just not invented .
i think that bach would have been excited if he had the <unk> possibilities of modern modern <unk> .
i can do today the <unk> that bach had , on the modern wing , to sound what a <unk> can &apos;t .
also from beethoven , you know that he had heard more deaf than he had ever heard .
today , modern orchestra is able to play everything , which one orchestra has been rejected by the time .
that &apos;s why the composers are dependent upon us to reinvent the pieces again .
it &apos;s been audible by what they &apos;ve imagined just in the mind .
and also , what you would think in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m talking about today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what is envy ?
did you even know jealous ?
and how felt that ?
sucks .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
if i come and come with my little v w <unk> , and i &apos;m going wrong , it comes up .
i shoot something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need for n big car ?
that &apos;s the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have to afford that n a car ?
and then i immediately fall out , this is unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word of justice , this awkward sense .
this organism has invented a great way to get out of inconvenient emotions like envy .
they can also try and make words like revenge or something like that .
and i want to explain something about this mechanism today or something that is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from a lie .
but don &apos;t you think about the lie , you might have heard of you , if people say , no one has the intention of building a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he <unk> them .
one of a lie , you can see that liars doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to see that it has very different in mind .
he doesn &apos;t think they and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , and they do have to do themselves .
you need this lie to get a <unk> to maintain a <unk> .
they can blow them less easily , yes , <unk> , or too .
you need time .
from that time , an anecdote that you might know .
spanish painter <unk> picasso once once a woman .
and this woman was <unk> that the portrait was not similar to her .
picasso says , wait for it .
they &apos;re always more similar .
at this point , if you laugh , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn something that artists can very well tell us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to a lie .
the artist &apos;s sharing with you something , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if she just looks just in the mirror .
the artist is sharing with you in a portrait of a portrait , which you &apos;re not going to be familiar with , if you &apos;re looking at this piece of art .
and then this awkward feeling disappears , it may not be similar to you , and they &apos;re always more similar .
so here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , even in the middle of the mythology , in stories , it seems back .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true input , the mirror cannot lie , from that true input .
but we should just tell you that you can &apos;t tell a woman to say that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere .
so here &apos;s what we understand under <unk> <unk> , again .
we need this lie at this point that a lie that we can &apos;t do with , without that we can &apos;t live on .
we have not only in the art of art , in <unk> , but also in science such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife of <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of the person .
that human beings should be <unk> by the monkey , and , yes , there &apos;s a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she <unk> she ran to her husband and she said , well , that &apos;s what charles is writing .
human beings should have <unk> or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent the people coming out of that .
why do we have to prevent people any knowledge of something if it &apos;s true ?
because without that <unk> , we can &apos;t live .
because we are at this self-deception , that feeling great , descent of the highest creatures , not from one of such things such as an organism like an organism , which exists on a stone , and whatever things , that &apos;s for us .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
we need to prevent the people all of things , especially when they are true .
and so you can see how slowly this mechanism , and what the traces look like that it &apos;s leaving on something else than this great picture of us , i want to give you another story .
it &apos;s a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to love him , because he has a propensity to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re <unk> at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being used in a moral place , the <unk> , we should try to replace it by replacing it by the <unk> .
so let &apos;s do that , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the truth behind us .
so a little bit of <unk> that &apos;s not interested in <unk> .
it &apos;s interested in <unk> .
but there are no charities that we can look for ourselves , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s just the second best .
he signed up .
and <unk> , you didn &apos;t tell his teacher that you &apos;d like to put burning and be happy to get out of the fire afterwards .
no , it doesn &apos;t look much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of that we &apos;re in charge of the risks that we just do when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and this is the one that <unk> , in the heart of the <unk> , knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this <unk> between unconscious and a conscious who instantly <unk> , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know they look very differently , that they can sound much better for them and others .
and then just like these words that we also use in the language of the real correct speech .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know when we say that , the social story is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to share with you what we found in my institute .
what logic is this deception , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know is that it &apos;s valid to the outside .
i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is <unk> , which many of you know , and some of you estimate a few of them , very few .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is such a intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not <unk> , physical nature .
and if you have people who are a solid belief that they own a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been <unk> from the soul to life , then they &apos;re kind of like a mental framework , which is kind of like a mental framework , which is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , yes .
and now , from this soul , you &apos;re now thinking that in this nature of nature , in that nature , it means it &apos;s in the latin , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and then , if that guy <unk> over the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from outside to humans .
so we &apos;re going to perceive them as something , which should be present for our lives .
and if you have this assumption in front of your eyes , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky , to improve our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> you know from school .
now this is a <unk> one that describes the logic .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
here they need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
namely , to lie , you can just apply this logic of logic .
in this room , three sentences come in .
the first phrase is <unk> , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put it in particular in particular .
a third sentence that shows up immediately by people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say , who doesn &apos;t have a soul , which is dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic of this logic , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical .
i can say everything .
the logic makes no statements about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic makes no statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critical is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our consciousness feels immediately that you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s as if the opposite sentence is already proven and assuming .
because in fact , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , it &apos;s just using two sentences to be correct , and a third <unk> that looks like it would be like doing something with it , and we can save our <unk> .
so , we do that as if it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things at various examples .
in the present way , we have a very modern example , which keeps filling out the <unk> .
you have to start with this , you know , one of the things that you have to do is a <unk> of philosophy , present .
so this has to do with it that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> <unk> called johannes <unk> , and he named <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which is from pure nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you place that exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack should go first .
it &apos;s right in the middle .
so the <unk> are introduced .
<unk> forces are solving each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
and just if you bring another example , so if she does a haystack get bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and it doesn &apos;t need any reason .
automatically , he &apos;s going to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re being driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be driven by the larger pile of a bunch that attract you right now , and then you really have to feel that there &apos;s something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re already in <unk> here in <unk> , i remember the <unk> in brain science .
there &apos;s a <unk> , which is called wolf <unk> , and he says , sometimes wolf <unk> said , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can get back to the second set of the second sentence , and they can say if wolf has <unk> right , he doesn &apos;t have any <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can be able to read almost daily in newspaper , they find that in the third sentence .
this looks like this , you know , who has no <unk> , can &apos;t be drawn to his actions and claims to responsibility , and he &apos;s so <unk> .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove to you if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so , as if the first sentence is wrong from the first sentence , as if you would have to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do that , if you want anything to test yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to make a lie .
so , for example , for example , if you get to a person you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please use the german word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
they &apos;re not allowed to call it a little more politically .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be one , for some of these <unk> , you &apos;ll see that you can &apos;t prove that .
and you already have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy doing it to make themselves understand that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he was fooled .
because he led them to a <unk> that he didn &apos;t care at itself .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in the need to prove themselves to the need to prove that there is <unk> .
so , in the kind of climate change , you experience the brilliance of a lie .
and if you have such an opportunity again to feel that <unk> in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make others happy if you don &apos;t remember that in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve got to ask myself if i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and i wondered if i wanted to give a talk here and give my idea .
i have to be honest , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , and i realized it was hard to talk about my idea .
and i may perhaps think i &apos;m trying to introduce you .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , quite many ideas .
i &apos;m probably part of the two nice girls , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s made for this bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve already started to study engineering engineering in <unk> , technical school , i think , i think kit , you know .
and i &apos;ve got to berlin in the &apos; 80s for berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and we didn &apos;t have it in <unk> .
there were <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> , the <unk> was called <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
because a good engineer has either made great cars or <unk> .
but it &apos;s <unk> like &apos; n <unk> out of that kind of a hundred watts of the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy thing to berlin .
and i &apos;m grateful that he was grateful that he &apos;s having the word again again , because they didn &apos;t want to use the word , because the one left was bad .
however , it wasn &apos;t like that in the <unk> years .
there was the fact that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you thought it was evil .
the place of <unk> , but it was called wind and the sun and the sun , and that &apos;s where i started the <unk> .
and yes , a lot of what i &apos;ve been told today is very , very , because many , many beautiful statements were in it that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i &apos;ve been working 11 years in the collective , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if you have a no said that was the <unk> , it &apos;s got a completely <unk> , and i &apos;ve got a lot of time for 10 years , if i really had my great maybe <unk> , because all the colleagues of my father always <unk> him , you &apos;ve got the money on the window into your child .
it &apos;s dealing with bollocks .
and that was really very , very , very <unk> , and you also come into this in a phase , just diving this image on <unk> , where i &apos;ve asked myself , after 10 years , there were still a thousand <unk> at the time , <unk> , <unk> in the collective of the collective , whether that really is that great .
and i got it up to <unk> , and then we &apos;ve got friends in the company of <unk> , which then became the <unk> <unk> of one of the world &apos;s largest <unk> in the world .
a <unk> , but , of course , we &apos;ve got the problem of a growing company , and we &apos;ve got <unk> , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start again and go back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to say , it starts to say , again , it &apos;s going crazy .
and i brought you a project with you that i want to introduce you now .
and the title of my talk was , yes , you get too a hundred percent renewable .
and we &apos;ve just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where could you be using a memory of a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have a renewables at 15 percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
that &apos;s simply not technological .
if you get more <unk> to each other , the system begins to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians , when they &apos;re <unk> our equipment .
they always say , why ?
we have 20 percent of us in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically the european european .
if we had in europe , in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
and the question was simple , the numbers of this was <unk> , and the first contacts started with the island , just calculate .
how big would you have to be a battery , so you have an island in 20 , 30 , 30 , 40 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go on a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a hundred <unk> performance is about a hundred <unk> performance on the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear power nuclear power , because this is a particularly fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , which is happening , is deleted with diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission .
this goes fast .
it &apos;s such a box .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
in that run , three of the <unk> , two will always wait .
yes , there &apos;s the load down there .
we also get very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or a system , which is only in small amounts here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the diesel is going to be <unk> and the wind , sun <unk> the burden on the larger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy a year , not the performance on the moment , you have to turn the diesel off .
that is , at the moment you have to worry that renewables can sort of take over the net .
of course , you can only do that if you &apos;re managed in some way in some way .
there &apos;s no one in the world .
that &apos;s in a small way , so you can also use your <unk> in the car for a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you actually do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s going on .
but if you want to <unk> some of these <unk> , and they want to build a web , it &apos;s going to be very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 to <unk> , and then there &apos;s this rest here , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you do that from batteries .
that will be a energy energy , which is then hydrogen , methane , methane , to the gas , you know , it will be then .
they have to go more to a <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know , what &apos;s because with a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
and they have wind and the sun and the burden of <unk> and came to the outcome , a very exciting result , that you have a middle of about 50 cents a <unk> to about 50 cents a <unk> , about <unk> cents a <unk> .
this was the very first calculation six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper , like that , when the average age goes up five percent per year .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what would it have to be done ?
have negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we &apos;re even 20 percent of petrol with diesel , and we don &apos;t have any <unk> on the other stuff .
and the <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> on the island , is what we find great .
do we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of to map the electrical history of the island in the island at three very precisely .
so , we &apos;ve been looking for first to find the largest battery of the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> is in the early &apos; 70s with bbc <unk> , which was developed , and then they got <unk> to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of performance , and it can bring for six hours for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then they started .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he stands to the hall in the hall in fact , which looks like the entire dynamic behavior of this grid , so in the back of the hall , it looks like the diesel is the diesel , which is the diesel that we simulate with .
over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable in order to sort of represent the <unk> on the web .
and you can see here again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> in the net .
this is what we see here again , again , the diesel here , again , again , the individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since <unk> was actually finished , until today , <unk> , basically , everything that &apos;s going on between the individual system of electronics in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define as a company , which is just between the subject and the subject of the web and everything in between .
you have to be able to communicate to the battery , and you can also communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is that , in this island , it &apos;s basically all of the <unk> things that we &apos;re going to get , if we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , what &apos;s going to go back and forth right now , <unk> , how to go , on the island , we have <unk> up to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun <unk> .
<unk> then offers <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate <unk> , and we can start integrating <unk> , because you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re with 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can <unk> by <unk> , you can do that by <unk> , yes , you should definitely do that , but you will never get rid of the memory .
and that &apos;s the n of the message .
and so many people come and look at this because you can see what problems you get .
when we turn out the diesel , you &apos;re not having this spinning mass that causes some inertia of the web .
and our <unk> <unk> , basically , is basically rotating out of the rotating masses of large <unk> , where the wave always turns around europe around europe .
we look into this grid , you see the 50 hertz , and when it becomes <unk> point nine hertz , we &apos;re starting to start a little bit of <unk> <unk> , then a little <unk> steam in , then we come back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly accurate .
if you get that somewhere , it &apos;s a while .
the <unk> reserves had at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time , they can respond to another .
if you don &apos;t have that , that spinning mass , you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can put two milliseconds with this big battery in two milliseconds .
and then you can see what enormous <unk> exists .
and the message is , we need to masses on these rotating masses , if we say our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do that at all .
and then we have to break our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is simply called the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> right now , <unk> from <unk> , because we don &apos;t know , or <unk> , because this is not going .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can have the capacity to break down the <unk> capacities , by bringing <unk> stores into the net .
now , there &apos;s a lot of studies for that now .
and for that purpose , people will always come and look at our <unk> , sort of our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take a piece of future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not , there &apos;s fine , <unk> , we &apos;ve never accounting for it .
we &apos;ve got 30 <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just just go out of that in the next 30 years we &apos;re going to be able to store the same capacity on the entire world .
very simple , it will come .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve seen in the last two years now that scientists are asking to my site .
we &apos;ve got now over 10 million <unk> , and we have a <unk> right now to the german web now .
that &apos;s going to happen next april .
so , from that you also realize that there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s just about that <unk> , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is right .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so we &apos;ve always tried to do that in arguments , these <unk> , which are <unk> , which have a little bit of a web , which has nothing to do with our nothing .
and the question is , really , if you make yourself completely independent from any fossil or <unk> <unk> that will be <unk> somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> to them , you &apos;re an island .
and then they &apos;re just using that , which is there in the sun and the wind there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy , and i &apos;m also grateful that they said , energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and in that , also the talk from <unk> <unk> , that you can be <unk> again and use the energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet and have a vision .
and you really have to be pretty <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , the los angeles times , the los angeles times , he went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless who played a violin , who had just two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles on that later a book , which was <unk> , with robert lopez and jamie <unk> , and jamie <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> at the <unk> and her career .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a <unk> , and 30 years later he lived on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend reading a book or to look at the film , so that it &apos;s not just the wonderful connectedness that between these two men was born , but also how the music helped make this connection , and how it allowed them to get the instrument , the <unk> , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , to walt disney hall .
he had just heard a demo by beethoven &apos;s first and the fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> clay over yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and about the dodgers , the dodgers could never create in the baseball world , and all of all about the <unk> passage in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s symphony .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , where it was that nathaniel was interested in <unk> .
i have to mention that nathaniel didn &apos;t say medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric shocks and with <unk> and handcuffed , a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
now , as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages . they are sometimes so bad , and he disappears in the streets of <unk> row , always exposed to the <unk> and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in fact , a <unk> was nathaniel when we started with our first class in walt disney hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and didn &apos;t have lost .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted to poison him in the sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid i could lose him , that he could sink in one of his stages , and that i started to destroy his relationship to the violin , when i started talking about scale and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was playing , i realized that in <unk> , a complete change went on .
it was , as if he stood under the impact of the unseen medicine , a chemical reaction that was catalyst .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding a quiet curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle he took his violin , and began to play a few clips from <unk> to play , and then asked me to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , started by bach , through beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a <unk> knowledge about music , but it connected to her very close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i just know about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music , and he was talking about music , from this <unk> , confused man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , was a <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to get his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> conditions .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is why we &apos;re doing music , so that we have something that in all of us , deep inside of us , our feelings , through our artistic lens , can actually shape our creativity .
and the reality of that term comes all of us , and moved , inspired and united .
so , as a nathaniel set , the music brought back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who recognized his talent and recognized it .
and i &apos;m always going to with nathaniel music back to walt disney hall or <unk> row at <unk> row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only have two loved ones .
this first one , which was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was bred in <unk> to the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could think of it to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
one day , the head of the company called the company , and i asked if i could tell you if i had an event about the <unk> of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our cooks , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve got the oceans in terms of the ocean in the last 50 years .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love the tunas , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , they have collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i think or <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds are required to get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it also doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here &apos;s finally a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported her .
the day before the event , i called the ceo of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that to grow so far in the sea , that you don &apos;t have the environment <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will be distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before this event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to agree .
now , i <unk> with a couple of people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally have biologists to <unk> .
let &apos;s call him don too .
don , i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , rainforests , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in assumption , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god who tasted fish after that conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know your fish ever better , you love the fish .
i first eaten him in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had spoken for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came to the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
stop twice .
it was still delicious .
who can make some fish taste so well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t cooked the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on what they were basically wetlands .
they did that by <unk> the land .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and she took back back out of the land and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that work , not economically .
and ecologically it .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds for this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water from the water .
they literally have the levers .
instead of the water , instead of using water , they used the channels to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 of <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and the <unk> and his company , the ecological destruction completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin , and part of a crocodile in the kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and they fought us through the wetlands , and i was <unk> and <unk> , have <unk> up to my knees , and <unk> will be <unk> .
this is what he takes a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , this is a pattern of bundle a pattern of bundle it into the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent most of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
and i asked him how he has become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls into more <unk> of rare birds and algae and odd <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak over this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i interrupted him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it be that your fish tastes so good ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo of the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
depending on a farm that your animals didn &apos;t feeds ?
later on this site , i went around on this site with <unk> , and i asked him , i said , &quot; well , for a place that seems to be so , unlike any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at the moment it was like a director of the director had to have an <unk> .
and we <unk> around the corner , and we were offered the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of nature <unk> , which literally is enough to the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
it <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you do your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year , on this site , it had 600,000 birds on this site , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest one , and one of the most important private health workers in europe has become in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t a good <unk> <unk> last thing you &apos;d like to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
depending on the your belly the better . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink the <unk> . a farm that doesn &apos;t drive their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , it should not even be there from the first place .
they breed in a city 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for <unk> .
every morning , they fly 240 miles to a farm .
and every night , they go back 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> white line .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of <unk> of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly 240 miles to the farm and fly it back 240 miles on the night ?
do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i &apos;d just quoted a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it <unk> . i don &apos;t like them <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m almost never cooking .
and yet , when i tried to try her in this restaurant in a <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted at all <unk> .
she liked sweet and it would be so if you take a bite bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to <unk> , and he was <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense to get into the body .
it has developed evolution in the course of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feeds their fish , a farm that measures their success on success of their predators .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he &apos;s enormous , because the water is going to be pouring in through this farm in the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that are rivers today tend to have them with themselves , chemical pollutants , from <unk> .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves the water is the water that &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy ; it cleans water .
so not just a farm that your animals don &apos;t feeds , not just a farm that measures their success on their success , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do that , because these love love , as romantic too , is <unk> .
you could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in which food actually taste <unk> .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love small <unk> . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that these are the things that makes the future , someone goes somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed .
a billion people are going to be starving .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever -- because of total inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because it has the logic of our <unk> over the last 50 years .
feed the grain , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on earth , chicken on the earth , they chicken , and all the time has just wondered , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the place . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in <unk> , an industry that &apos;s going to allow us to use this production , which enables that production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
it &apos;s threatened today , not due to <unk> <unk> , but due to <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile land , not through pumps , but by <unk> water , not by <unk> , but not by <unk> and nets , but not by <unk> and nets , but in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it never really has a really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that , in two billion years of <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses , which are not worlds for themselves , businesses , who are engaging , instead of <unk> , businesses , who are growing up rather than intense , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts who are not only <unk> .
because they are the people who are also experts .
and if i really be honest , you are a better chef than i ever be .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
now , if i want to see one thing today , it &apos;s that the total of the data we consume is larger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about <unk> , i want you to think about how we can use information , that pattern , otherwise , would not be seen .
so what we see here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a particular cause of death , we say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because , in fact , the people who are the most active , and they &apos;re at the <unk> over here .
we can go one step further , and then line the data and see the data and you see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , when we go on to go on and sort of , say , 40 years or younger , we see that accidents should even be the key cause of people to worry about .
and whoever <unk> sees that it &apos;s true of men .
so you can see that this is actually reminded of information and data in this way of swimming very closely in this way .
and if we can do this for data , why don &apos;t we do it for content itself ?
now what we &apos;ve got here are the <unk> of every single &quot; sports sport , &quot; which have ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually test it to my talk in their rooms .
you can have <unk> in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump right into a particular issue .
now , when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i click here , which is what i &apos;m looking at here on what lance armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and look at the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you look into this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re not looking at or not just <unk> .
you do something that is a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit more about what is a little crazy .
so what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single <unk> and reduce it on a little summary .
and the summary contains a short look , and a symbol of what it comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the popular ones .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
now , let &apos;s get a sense about the issues that are on the top of wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue .
now , after i chose government &apos; government , i know that the <unk> , which is what most of the things are meeting by the year &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t have a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to see when you go back and looked at this one .
looking at one of these summaries , i can then go into the subject of time <unk> &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all of you see .
now , when i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are <unk> . some come from science . some , you know , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono also is a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all ted prize winners .
you can see , we &apos;re surfing on the web as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from page to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise could be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites like this -- and we &apos;re going to bring these data points to every single website like this .
so i can go a step back and jump straight into a specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s important , because you just look at these websites in this way , the whole <unk> in this way , in the same way .
so , i can zoom in in a particular frame of time .
here &apos;s the side of the whole demonstration that i thought i &apos;ve given up to this .
and i can do everything i &apos;ve looked at today , again , again .
and if i look back to a step , and look at everything , i can rearrange the course of the course of the course , maybe after my <unk> . here i looked for <unk> , right here , right here , or here after live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and go to it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and every time it makes the picture bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk from the curse of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to the other , you start to go from many things to many things , and see patterns that would be otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then this past <unk> will be a new source of information information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get out of it .
and if we know , we might even get <unk> out of that .
and i hear that , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> deal of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus for school , every day per hour .
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a <unk> that my thoughts in the other worlds and a <unk> way of my mind , and in a <unk> way , <unk> curiosity .
and these curiosity also showed me that , when i wasn &apos;t in school , i was walking through the forests of the forests , walking and snakes and snakes and <unk> and <unk> , all home and looked at the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limitations of the potential .
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our amazing shows with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of miracles that we &apos;ve never had before .
so that &apos;s probably very good at that <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there &apos;s no video games , and there &apos;s no video games , with the <unk> movies , had the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to . when we read a book when we were reading a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen .
my response to this was drawing and painting from aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all that .
i was constantly caught by teachers , like me , hidden in the textbook .
creativity had to get out of creativity .
and this interesting thing happened , which was fascinated me to jacques <unk> &apos;s <unk> , was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never have to reach an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all of the things that i had imagined when i &apos;ve read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i decided .
the only problem that i was living in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
and i didn &apos;t let <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until finally , a <unk> in buffalo , new york , had been done , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , which is a real ocean , i got it only two years later when we moved to california .
now in the 40 years , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours of water , i spent about 3,000 hours of water . 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in <unk> life , how we really can hardly imagine .
the imagination of nature knows no limits , as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
so for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love of the ocean holds , with the same intensity as ever .
so , when i was an adult profession , it was the filmmaking .
this seemed to be the best way , my inner drive to tell stories , with my need to unite images .
as a child , i was constantly drawing comic books and so .
so films were the way to bring images and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;d like to do , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; and &quot; terminator , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to connect my preference for the <unk> , and they go to the filmmaking .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; to solve a <unk> problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we picked up with <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
and what came out of this was the first <unk> <unk> , which was ever in a movie .
this film didn &apos;t take a money to do that in fact , in fact , he played the costs of the manufacturing system , but i realized something fascinating : the audience all over the world was turning off the magic .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , it may be <unk> technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be involved in the united states . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot further .
together with <unk> , we created the type of liquid metal there . the success was going to depend on what this effect was going .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical . and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , with my great friend stan winston , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
so the basic idea of this company was , the stage analog processes with visual printers , etc . , to skip and the same with digital <unk> .
and then we did , and then we did a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the middle of the 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- for what we were doing , the company actually started to slow down .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which wrote the bar of visual effects and <unk> effects in the very new heights of visual effects , with comparable human , expressive characters that were made by <unk> , and the <unk> should be <unk> .
but the measuring bar made quite beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to do this .
so i shifted that , and i made this other film about the big ship , it &apos;s going down .
i &apos;ve been selling this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship . it became an <unk> <unk> process , a passionate film .
but in fact , i wanted to <unk> the real train of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
and i convinced them , by saying , &quot; we dive into the train . we shoot the real train .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it &apos;s going to go back to that your imagination can make a reality .
and we actually created a reality six months later , where i put myself in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic through a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so that really changed me .
and it &apos;s enormous . we had to build cameras and light and all kinds of things .
and i noticed , like very much this <unk> , a <unk> resemble .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> for planning .
you go into these capsule , then you &apos;re floating down into this dark , <unk> environment , where there is no hope on saving , if you can &apos;t get it back yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was literally obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , from the part of curiosity and science . it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could think of a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
on some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that didn &apos;t have seen before , and we saw the science at the time when we saw them , even more words .
so that &apos;s really <unk> me , and i wanted more .
and so i made a slightly more unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker as a filmmaker in ice , and i &apos;m going to <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started to showed up the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and explored with <unk> .
we went to the dawn of titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to be <unk> and looking at the <unk> of the ship , which was never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the network , and you didn &apos;t have any resources , so we evolved the technology .
so here i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that these <unk> are quite similar here , and i know once the band has played there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little <unk> trip through the aisles of the ship .
i &apos;m actually <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically there in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the most devastating form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i <unk> around a corner , i always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i ran over the <unk> of the vehicle as we turned the film .
the set was an actual copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize this <unk> that you &apos;re using such <unk> <unk> , and so your consciousness can be embarrassed to the vehicle into this other form of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in a few decades , what could happen in a few decades when you have <unk> to explore something or to do something about it , in all sorts of things that i can imagine as a <unk> .
so after these expeditions , we started what we &apos;ve seen at the bottom , really appreciate what we &apos;ve seen , for example , that <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , these are like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in the sunlight , as we do that .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was very interested in <unk> , which was back in my childhood again .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they have to do with nasa , and they &apos;re sitting in the <unk> and <unk> right . they &apos;re going to go to russia , and then go to russia , and then fly to the international protocol , and then fly to the international <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it went out that i went to <unk> with the deep sea .
i took them with them , and i &apos;ve got them access to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who was interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to take samples and test instruments and test instruments and so on .
and we turned myself , but we were doing science , which is actually , in fact , <unk> .
so this was so <unk> , the circle between my existence , at the time as a child , and doing it in the reality .
and over the course of that discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now you &apos;re sure now , a director has to lead , a leader will be like a <unk> or something .
but i didn &apos;t mind a lot of leadership before i have these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why am i doing that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re going to play the manufacturing costs . the amount of fame is not trace .
everybody thinks i &apos;m between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have <unk> the nails on a towel on the beach .
i have all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the challenge , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that exists , and because of the weird connection that comes up with a small group of people forming a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked over for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning that you have in front of each other because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole way around the way around , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , when you &apos;re working on the lake , and you can never explain it to a way .
there is a connection , each other respect .
so , when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you were respected and respected their team in return .
and it really became changed .
so there i stood again with a small team on <unk> terrain , and we were called &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
hugely exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we have been to a <unk> family for a half and a half years .
this is what changed my way of making films , completely .
there were people who thought we were really doing this <unk> really well and transported to the planet .
for me , it was more of a more powerful way to do my job , the real process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all that ?
what lessons is we learned ?
i think it &apos;s first curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
to me , young filmmakers , who say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t give you one .
you know that for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; fail is no alternative . &quot;
but in the arts and the study , you have to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> there .
no important endeavor , the innovation called the <unk> .
you have to be ready to take such risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you to be on the way . failure is not an alternative , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
and this may be surprised by the foundation of the foundation , mostly around vaccines and seed , about the things we need to invent and provide the poorest two billion to a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually even more important than anyone on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years . it &apos;s too little rain , and things will change in the way that their fragile environment can &apos;t withstand .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , climate change will be terrible for you .
and also , the <unk> is very important for them .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of the price , the energy would be far by the most effective .
well , the <unk> has fallen over time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in <unk> , and so we have refrigerators , <unk> , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price in half -- we hit a new barrier , and that barrier is on co2 together .
co2 warms up the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative effects . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the <unk> effect that the natural ecosystems that can &apos;t adapt to that rapid change and collapse systems .
now , the exact exact relationship between a <unk> and it <unk> <unk> , and where the other consequences are , there are some of them , but not very many .
and there &apos;s an ambiguity of how bad these are going to follow , but they will be extremely bad !
i asked the <unk> several times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
not enough , or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will move on .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a <unk> truck , which has to be under a <unk> bridge , and then you can put it in a sort of <unk> .
this one has to go down to zero .
well , we run a lot of <unk> every year , about 26 billion tons .
every american americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
the average is about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to make changes that lower it down to zero .
it has gone up far .
only different economic changes have influenced it at all , and we need to go from <unk> increase in reduction and a reduction , to zero .
this equation has four factors . a bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to bring it towards zero , and it &apos;s going to be dependent on the number of people from the service that each person is in average , the average energy of any service .
so let &apos;s look at each one , and let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
now this is a fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it &apos;s going to step at nine billion <unk> to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines that are <unk> and <unk> , we could reduce it by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> to make these services almost anyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do <unk> and use less , but average , that number is going up every year , and therefore , more than double the number of services per person .
here we see a very basic service . there are light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , for efficiency , the e , the energy of a service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in <unk> , through others , through new ways , there are a lot of services in <unk> , there are a lot of services to use some single services to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , like manufacturing <unk> , 105 00 : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , is the range of improvement in a very much much small way .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction by a factor of three or maybe even a factor .
but at the first three factors we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out , if you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn gas : no .
it &apos;s almost every electricity supply for electricity today , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the &quot; miracle &quot; , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
usually you &apos;re just next to you and some of them , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to get <unk> and get a miracle in a very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i do this ?
is there a kind of natural <unk> , a demonstration that <unk> the notion of people here ?
i reminded myself last year when i got mosquitos , and i kind of liked the people .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
that &apos;s the energy that i fell .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
you told me they don &apos;t bite bite . you won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or multiple of the existing scale of scale and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for , i really see five who can afford these big demands .
i have tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
they might afford a <unk> contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my statement is that we need to work on all of those five , and we can &apos;t give them up because they have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at it first of burning fossil fuels from either coal or natural gas .
what you &apos;ve got to do there may seem easy , but that &apos;s not . you &apos;d have to capture all the co2 , which is coming out of the <unk> , pick up under pressure and then and hope that it stays there .
there are some <unk> who can do this for 60 percent -- 80 percent of them , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get up to 100 percent , and an agreement for running your co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who &apos;s going to make sure ?
who can do something guarantee , which literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough problem .
next : <unk> .
it has three big problems , and the cost , especially in <unk> countries , and the question is to make sure you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human cooperation that the fuel doesn &apos;t use for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that you should work on .
the last three of the five i put in .
it &apos;s renewables that they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that these technologies are producing dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times more area than a normal power station .
and then these sources are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be any day , and it doesn &apos;t blow the wind all the time .
so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way , the energy in times when it &apos;s not available to you .
so there &apos;s big <unk> here . there are challenges in transmission , for example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you need to deal with the risk that the energy from different comes from different from different comes from different from different comes from different .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and in order to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , cell phones , <unk> , for everything , and that &apos;s what i found with the amount of electronic energy , which is what the world uses .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these <unk> sources to say about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of it .
if you want to rely on 100 percent on it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we come to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that are working on this . hundreds of things .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many people in the ted group .
bill big has several companies , among other things , called the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i funding a company , which , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach is tracking .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a surprise that some good concepts lying around .
and the key thing is , instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , which is the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate reasonable simulate , whether it would work , but then there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that , you know , it looks like it &apos;s functioning .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of the reactors as a <unk> .
instead of breaking off your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often as &quot; a <unk> reactor reactor .
that doesn &apos;t really solve the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
it &apos;s the u.s. economy for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re going to use a little bit cheap and simple , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and it &apos;s still being <unk> , and hopefully it will be <unk> and cement .
so , to reach that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , completely switch .
the other note says , if we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
that &apos;s going to be a key feature of this .
if we go back to this , what should the 2020 look like in 2020 ?
it should be again with the two elements .
we should use the <unk> , to take reduction in the way , and the less we <unk> , the smaller it will be <unk> and also the temperature .
but actually , this note is this note for the things we do , which is not completely to the great <unk> , or even something less important as the other ones that represents the speed of innovation .
these are the breakthroughs we have to pursue with <unk> , and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this topic .
now , al gore &apos;s book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> energy <unk> . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame where this can be discussed , because we need to have support of all sides .
there &apos;s some things that come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very more specific wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick up the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , &quot; <unk> <unk> without co2 , i would take that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , this wish will be <unk> between the long term and in the short run in the short term , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to put ourselves for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they should not only talk about co2 .
you should go to these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the kind of <unk> of the low funds that these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to lead dialogue and complete full of the things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all of the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only to have a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian way to make sure that it &apos;s possible to make it reasonable .
the difficult step is building the first way of building another billion , which is the <unk> and the place of actually building the first one .
once the first thing finished , when it &apos;s like promised , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the energy density is so different from <unk> as we know it .
to understand the right thing : that means to build deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column nuclear <unk> , that consumed , and then the process starts , and then the process goes up and goes down ?
<unk> : right . now you don &apos;t have to <unk> the reactor , so many people and many control that can go wrong . this thing where you can open it and make things like that , and that &apos;s not good !
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think of a column -- it &apos;s buried without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burning 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> that offers a solution to the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can leave it in -- there &apos;s much less trash with this method -- you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it in the next .
and we &apos;re starting by taking the waste that &apos;s already there that &apos;s in these <unk> or <unk> , which is our <unk> .
so what &apos;s a problem for these reactors , what we fill in our filling , and it will dramatically reduce the <unk> during this process .
but while they &apos;ve been talking to different people around the world .
where is the biggest interest in doing this ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t set ourselves up on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for everything that &apos;s &quot; nuclear , &quot; <unk> &quot; in the name . there &apos;s a big interest in russia , india , china , china -- i &apos;ve talked about , and talked about how this fits the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was made .
that &apos;s an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , that &apos;s why everyone who &apos;s done a quick reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and probability of doing something like this ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent , and then for 20 years .
this is sort of the deadline that we &apos;ve demonstrated the <unk> we have to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it might be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of that , which , in the same way , when their approaches to work that are working for their pilots to work for their pilots .
and it would be best , if it &apos;s multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
about the big possible breakthroughs , is this the greatest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there are the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to be difficult , but maybe we say that about us .
and so there are different , but the beauty of this is that a million times a million times a million times a million times how one , say , a <unk> , and that &apos;s why they can deal with the problems , and those are mainly the radiation , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in <unk> .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to come up with <unk> in order to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you ate too much , and it &apos;s a heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> that deals with various techniques to delay warming , so that we &apos;d get 20 or 30 years longer around us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you should not even work on insurance , because you might not even work on insurance so that you keep eating , because you know that one is going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if the importance of this problem leads to the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> about whether you have to be available , if things come faster , or this innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that are going to do with the clouds that are going to move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can say at all , where there &apos;s a chance of a million .
the <unk> here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is now , if you have all kinds of <unk> problems , to invest in something that you &apos;ve got later on , and it &apos;s coming out , in fact , the ipcc don &apos;t necessarily have the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world , and there is no big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economically , and at the same time you get the co2 off , the skeptics will say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not sure that it doesn &apos;t care , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the most successful <unk> argument that , if you use all of that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are suffering from malaria and so on , that there is a dumb waste of resources to invest on malaria and so on .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
they shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
you get too large <unk> , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that . for me , most of a waste .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be very much more expensive .
if you get the <unk> that you get is a very high <unk> , then just the rich to keep up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing your lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why isn &apos;t the research anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his previous stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he &apos;s going to get the <unk> .
and this is a leader that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy to be a little bit crazy .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter <unk> asked a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> has to have a maximum structure of <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti , about <unk> tape , about <unk> thread and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because it urges people to work very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve transformed it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> of <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task of taking impressions in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with them .
normally , most people start to do about the task .
you talk about what it &apos;s going to look like , what it &apos;s going to look like .
and then they invest a little bit in planning and organization , and they put spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> of the <unk> .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone got the marshmallow , and they gently put him out of the marshmallow , step back and &quot; <unk> ! &quot; they admire her work .
but what &apos;s always happened , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the brain causes that the whole thing , the whole thing is , and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; as others , and under the <unk> are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused and producing <unk> .
and of course , there are also teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and under the best , new graduate students .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
like peter , they didn &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is , how does this come ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the children spend in the head of spaghetti to be <unk> .
they don &apos;t spend time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find a proper plan , ok .
and then they realize it .
so what happens when they put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what happens is that they &apos;re starting to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they had a chance to repair <unk> prototypes .
<unk> can see this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids will get immediately feedback which works and not .
so the power to work with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , but not much , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
<unk> is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they are triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average , but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
if you put an <unk> administrator on the team , you &apos;re getting significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you &apos;re looking around and recognize this team . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they conduct the process , they understand it .
and the team that <unk> and in the work will dramatically improve the performance of the team .
specialized , skills and <unk> and <unk> , lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , you get about six , which have robust structures .
i was trying something exciting .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the <unk> .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize for the winners .
what happened to do with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this one happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built an <unk> tall , he would have carried the price home .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high school cells have a strong effect ?
we went through this practice with the same students .
what happened now ?
now they understand the advantage of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
that &apos;s how bad team became one of the best .
they produced the highest construction at least time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you might ask , why would somebody actually invest in a <unk> time ?
the reason is , i &apos;ll help help use digital tools and processes to help teams , to create cars , video games , video games .
and what the <unk> does , she helps to identify hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a shared language , or a common language , or the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , you can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples from all around the world as people optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the final lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it demands that we all set up our senses on the task , and that we think we think we &apos;re thinking optimal , how our feelings and what we do , in the challenge that lies ahead .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything it needs to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so we &apos;re going to do that as if we could have a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room must go in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i &apos;ve often asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go into the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or twitter or america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you can be drawn to the <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because we don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that has ever been on this planet , no matter how scale it is , health , wealth , wealth , declining <unk> .
there was never before a time like this .
my <unk> died when they were 60 .
my grandparents gave back this number to <unk> .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there should be better at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid who &apos;s born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have formed the demographics in the earth in a way that doesn &apos;t have any war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have it <unk> . pop !
in the rich world , the millions of us are still threatened by only one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of scientific method .
and from my view of view , the scientific method is to try and see if it &apos;s working , it &apos;s going to change if it doesn &apos;t , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world are going to bed every day .
that number goes up , and it gets very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> the world and <unk> .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon if we &apos;re not from that chaos , we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land that they live on , they rape .
i think we can power this world to energy that they don &apos;t even destroyed .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is holding me up at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now , never .
and we were also never able to be able to make it reasonable <unk> , as we can .
we &apos;re at the verge of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think we need to go back hundreds of 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we have massive <unk> progress in which we have massive <unk> than now .
people are pulling themselves in their faith , and that &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free it free .
it &apos;s not the truth of the truth .
and listen , everybody has a right in your opinion , even a right in your opinion .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have their own facts , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t have them .
and i took a while to find out .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to bumping up on resistance , to the resistance of what the most effective healthcare system is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and drove away .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
the same thing just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote an article written about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules were on a certain rather than random kind of <unk> <unk> in nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles worried me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who were crazy to me mad at all .
these were people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that made me mess .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we &apos;re not the same relationship with progress .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking to talk about it , with little quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think what the reasons are .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science in science , and there &apos;s no reason why this should not be like that .
you can just call some names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were always right . be skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now it &apos;s coming : if you get evidence , you have to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that from the reason we &apos;re in an epidemic of fear now , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which brought the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see if that was true .
in countless studies , we should be done , which is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , in england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we think we think what we think we think about what makes us feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents on a <unk> that &apos;s going to give us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was <unk> .
disaster in the fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which the <unk> for measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s horrible .
what &apos;s happened we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
is anybody here ?
has one in the audience ever ever seen someone on measles ?
not very often .
not even in this country , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
these are a lot of deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can put it in denial , and people like jenny could be around and <unk> messages around and around messages like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because it doesn &apos;t connect a cause and correlation correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
and this is something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst humanity of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
it &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed a <unk> with a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul is talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and that people should just stop <unk> .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul &apos;s talking in a public health program , he can &apos;t statements without the arms of <unk> .
he gets your phone phone , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need it to say , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , return the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children are going to die , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine wrote me a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
nobody said that ever before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate your child against <unk> .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there was someone on a lagos morning in lagos , and flying in an airplane , right now , in a moment , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that it &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t it like it &apos;s not .
we love to cover ourselves . we love that .
so today , have you all taken vitamins tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , which helps you move on .
i know they &apos;ve done this because half the americans do that every day .
they take this stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
you make your urine . they almost never do anything .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that . our healthcare system is it .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishing cold and <unk> itself that can afford it .
so we &apos;re running away before , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it &apos;s really serious , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of equipment here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scream to me and say , &quot; what does it take ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the <unk> that says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to be mammography , &quot; or some <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go on this way , where i believe and magic evidence and science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , which we know that they can break the course of aids over the course .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will be <unk> worse than each other from this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this absurd struggle between the <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
that &apos;s a <unk> debate . it must stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every <unk> , was changing by people .
you know , there was no <unk> of paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of this has worked and some of them don &apos;t .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more closely . and of course , there &apos;s risk . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and this stuff can help millions of people , millions of people to increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we neglect genetically modified food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m always hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have big fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all that ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it works , but the idea that we should not allow science to do , because we &apos;re afraid we have a real <unk> , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this right now .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , unprecedented food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s getting time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing so far , we &apos;re guilty about something that we do , i think , not guilty , was high-tech colonialism , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our not worthy , and we &apos;ve got to really stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to get into this ridiculous time , and into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i &apos;m definitely going to .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can ask these machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them , where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;ll move it to where we want .
we need these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine , and we &apos;ll be going into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is to me , this is what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it may seem strange that a magician was interested in it , unless you look at it like me , as &quot; a deception that believes into something that &apos;s a real enough thing . &quot;
in other words , in some cases , a measurable effect in some studies have shown a measurable effect , the <unk> , and that &apos;s just because the person thinks of what happens to her is a <unk> or a kind of a measurable effect in the body , a measurable effect in the body called the <unk> .
a deception becomes something real because somebody perceiving it .
so , let me understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that at least since the 1950s it is in every single <unk> for children .
i even learned him from <unk> <unk> <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll explain it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife so in my hand .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve , or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to just <unk> my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time moves at any time , as long as i &apos;m going to get here , nothing can go into my sleeve or getting out .
and the goal here is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , when everything goes well , the knife is going to be held by my bare body .
and in fact , it &apos;s so stuck in its place that i can shake it without the knife fall .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often look at little kids , which is magic , because you can &apos;t learn a lot about deception , if you &apos;re very much , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
so many of you are in the room , you know this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m making my wrist <unk> to make sure nothing in my sleeve or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i <unk> my wrist is that there &apos;s the actual secret of illusion .
and in the moment , where i take my hand out of you , so you see them from the back , this finger here , my <unk> , just from there , where he was in a position where he was so <unk> .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right here .
and if i <unk> , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way he &apos;s processed information , one , three , three , but it looks as a group .
but that &apos;s why it &apos;s not happening now , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to put it there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing that i &apos;m going to get out of , is going to hidden through this movement that the fingers are <unk> .
i &apos;ll take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
that trick you can demonstrate to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
because it turns out that , if you offer a placebo pill to a white pill , in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape in which you give the placebo placebo to a smaller pill to a smaller pill , and you color that blue and a letter on it , you &apos;re actually measurable more efficient .
and that , even though none of them are not <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? i really freak out .
but it turned out that that &apos;s not all .
when you take capsules that are more effective than pills .
a colored capsule , which is in yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
also , the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice the day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics , i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is ...
it also is a role to play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few of a <unk> substance that you injected to a patient .
that creates a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s a lot more powerful than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t appear as well as a capsule that works as well as the needle .
and none of it has a really reliable property . it &apos;s just our belief in it that makes us a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;ll take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
well , we know from the study that you have to grab to the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is a <unk> <unk> for a long time . she &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to start you a little bit about it .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and you go through it , until you <unk> on the other side .
if you fall out evil , if you &apos;re easy to fall out -- i showed this a couple of friends in the hotel room , and some of the people i didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost powerless .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you &apos;re going to look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive to the back here .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also <unk> if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
sorry . does it crazy ?
and so just a little bit through my skin and on the other hand .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in <unk> .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> itself , just to talk about a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see this right . &quot;
people in the <unk> come in .
so let me show you from nearby .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can do it .
sorry . when you get evil , look away , look away .
the people in the back , or the ones that eventually can see on the video later , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; well , it looks quite impressive , but if it was real , he would -- you know , there &apos;s a hole where it was really , would bleed to bleed . &quot;
okay , let me put a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
so , normally i would take the needle .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are not wounds .
but i think in this frame and with the intention of doing something real deception , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there and go from stage .
we &apos;re going to face a few days in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to it . thank you .
everybody is talking about happiness today .
i have some people count the number of books that were published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave them 40 to about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all these tide of work , there are multiple cognitive ones that can sort of make it kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive <unk> .
and this is true for <unk> , thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just a mess .
the first one is <unk> , to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could narrow it to , but the big one is something that we &apos;re going to give up , and we &apos;re going to take the complicated perspective on what well-being is .
the second case is the experience of experience and memory : basically , you &apos;re going to be between happiness in his life and happy with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its meaning to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> for one of my lectures , who said a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he added a pretty emotional , really emotionally , that has ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t care because he was a memory of <unk> ; the memory was ruined , and that memory was all that he had to keep .
what really tells us that is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past , but essentially the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that &apos;s the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt when i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the history of our life gets upright , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to feel about the doctor of saying , &quot; how did you feel lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , which are <unk> itself , and the <unk> self , and to confuse the two is part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this really starts with a basic reaction on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we do about telling stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re allowed to keep in our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who have a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s suffered from two ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how do these patients do ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patients had a much worse than a patient for a patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and what &apos;s worse is where the pain was at the end of the end , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a for b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
from the <unk> perspective of the <unk> , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a <unk> , and we &apos;ve done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually increase the <unk> of the patient a increase by simply rolling the hose in it without <unk> .
that will lead the patient is suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have to get the <unk> self that is a <unk> self , and you have to make that the <unk> self is a much better on the patient , because now you have given the patient a better story about its experience .
so what &apos;s a story about this ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that make the memory of us , and it applies to the stories that we invent .
and what a story is <unk> is changes , meaningful moments and end .
the end is very , very important , and in this case , <unk> the end .
now , the <unk> self lives continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this to -- you know , the psychological present is true than about three seconds . what is , you know , there &apos;s about 600,000 million of them in a lifetime , and most of them have no trace .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet , you kind of get the impression that you should count , what &apos;s going on during these moments of <unk> our lives .
it &apos;s a finite resource that we use while we &apos;re in the world .
and as we use them to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> self .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
if you have a vacation from <unk> itself , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first one , the <unk> vacation is twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
that doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> itself .
so for the <unk> self , a half vacation is hardly better than the <unk> vacation , because there are no new memories to be added .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is a <unk> self from a <unk> self . time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , we &apos;d say two <unk> at two different surgeons , and decide what to choose , which is what he is supposed to choose , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of self , and you can think of the <unk> yourself as one that &apos;s sort of the <unk> self by the experience of the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re a vacation very often in the case , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , largely , in the service of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think there &apos;s a holiday in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think relatively often about how often i think about other <unk> .
and i &apos;ve probably had my memories on this <unk> journey , i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with 600 images in it , i &apos;ve spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half a half .
there seems to be a disagreement .
well , i may be a little bit extreme , you know , how much appetite i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give it to a real question , why do we give it to the weight of that ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the <unk> all your pictures , and you get a <unk> drug , so that you &apos;re not going to remember .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you could choose another vacation , there is a conflict between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s not obvious at all , because if you think in the sense of time , you could get a answer . and if you could get a different answer in the senses .
so why we pick up the <unk> that we &apos;re choosing is a problem that gives us a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of self throw two words from happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is that <unk> itself ?
and then you would ask : how happy are these moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and you &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unk> itself over time .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is to think about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms is going to be different from happiness to happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being that really blew the exploration of happiness .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and happiness has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson we do , i think , is that they are really different .
you can know how happy someone with his life is , and that teaches you a lot about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to share with you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you were going to meet someone , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you &apos;d know something about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much insecurity .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life on a scale of 10 on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness does .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means happiness to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize yourself , you will do very different things at the end .
so the conclusion that i said here is that we really don &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason we don &apos;t know about happiness is that we &apos;re not looking at the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to be the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think that the people in california have to be happier when they are , we &apos;re living in ohio .
and what &apos;s happening is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what we say is in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could end up to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who are moving to california in hope to become happier .
well , your <unk> self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about this , you will remember how awful the weather was in ohio , and you will feel that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
well , when we talked a couple of weeks ago , i told myself that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this gallup poll .
is that something that you can share with , because now you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gallup survey is a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t have to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the <unk> itself .
if we were looking at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
the people in the year are unhappy , and they get increasingly less happy , the poorer they will .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean rarely seen so flat lines .
well , what happens is , obviously , that money doesn &apos;t raise a joint of money , but lack of money will certainly raise money , and we can measure that misery very , very clear .
in the spirit of the other self , the <unk> itself , you get a different story .
the more money you do deserves .
that &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in the whole american commitment to life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on their head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians are in general , that the country is generally going to take a look like serious and based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s recognition for the role of politics in politics .
the recognition will be slow to the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries it &apos;s happening .
people are recognizing that they should think of happiness when they think in politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore , or if they want to explore <unk> , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
as you &apos;re lucky , you &apos;re going to have different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , or should at least be the most interesting political debate about the <unk> over the next few years .
thank you for behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy as easy to save the world in reality as it is in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you , spend more time with the play bigger and <unk> games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a lot too much time when you think about how many problems we really have in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is this , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week is not nearly enough to solve the most important problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase dramatically .
i calculated that it took time at 21 billion hours a week .
it may seem to be a little bit of <unk> , so i &apos;ll repeat it , so i &apos;ll be able to work this : if we &apos;re problems like hunger , poverty , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to do games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the decade .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
why ? this picture describes quite exactly why i think games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion of play , so he &apos;s got built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a little fear , but also very very very great concentration , very , very , very , in solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see , a few nuances here , which is coming up to the top , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrow surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so , so we &apos;ve got some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so fast that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when they reach it , they &apos;re shocked to be able to actually be able to do that . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is just a little bit before a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces all over the world , if we take the barriers to attack the next century , the face of those who are on the edge of all the <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , unfortunately we see this face in real life , when we face hard problems .
i call it as a &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok . ok .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m like to do , &quot; in life i am bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home at berkeley , california , where i was studied in my ph.d. why we &apos;re in games better than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean , less successful , even though that .
we are doing more than that , and i &apos;m working on the relationship with motivation to do something more powerful , inspired by collaboration .
if we are in a <unk> , i believe that many of us will turn into our best version , at any time , to be able to solve the problem , trying to solve the problem , as long as you need to try again .
and in reality , when we &apos;re failing , when we hit in obstacles , we &apos;re often feeling different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings we never have when we play games , they just don &apos;t have them .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in play , thinking , you could not do anything ?
how can we take these feelings of play into reality ?
so , i looked like the world of warcraft , which is that the ideal environment gives me to the problem solving .
and i found some things to be able to do the epic act in <unk> .
so first , when you go into one of these <unk> , especially at world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to do with you a <unk> mission , and immediately immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at your current level in the game , right ?
so do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have to work , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you see <unk> . there &apos;s always something important .
and there are plenty of lots of staff .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working together , working with them , to end up with their epic mission .
that &apos;s what we have in real life not so simple , that feeling that there are lots of lots of a lot ready to stand .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in true life .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have to speak , + 1 , a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of <unk> like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s as satisfying , any time on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we would rather spend all of our time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until now , all the world of <unk> has spent millions of years to solve virtual problems from <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started walking upright .
so the first one is back up .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend now with playing games , that just makes sense when you think of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate . because it turns out we &apos;re using this whole time to play this whole time , actually change what we &apos;re capable of .
we &apos;re developing in collaborative thinking , thank you .
that &apos;s the truth . this is what i believe .
if you look at this interesting statistic , recently from a researcher , at carnegie mellon university : the average young person from today in a country with strong <unk> spends 10,000 hours of <unk> to the 21st .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , they &apos;re <unk> hours of the exact <unk> they spend in school , from five to the five school , to the degree of high school -- if you never do .
so we &apos;ve got a complete <unk> here on the young people in the same way that it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success for 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research on <unk> that , if we spend 10,000 hours of any theme of any subject to the 21st of year , we &apos;re going to get to master &apos;s .
we &apos;re going to get so good at whatever the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly the players are doing ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have any of the potential of the potential .
we have so many people in the world right now in the world who spend at least one hour per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the <unk> is developing <unk> that save energy and working on <unk> , instead of the player in the world , with the players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil can play online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started to think of what it &apos;s like to master these games .
here &apos;s the four things that i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do immediately , to make a challenge , with the belief that we have an educated hope for success .
the player always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it &apos;s worth trying to try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders denser social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that we show people more after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they defeated us .
and the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody is spending time with us , that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal , and to keep it in .
so the <unk> will allow you to grow by bonds , trust and another .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason for the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we can relax or do nothing .
we know that as human beings work optimal , when we do hard , make meaningful work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic epic .
players love to be part of awe at the <unk> missions .
here &apos;s a <unk> to back that on the right-hand light . you &apos;re familiar with all wikipedia , the greatest wiki .
the second largest lines in the world , at almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other lines in any other wiki .
they create an epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome , players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much of energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to see less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
so he says that it actually makes sense because players can achieve more than the real life .
they can actually make stronger social bonds than in the real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in play than real life .
so , he says it &apos;s perfectly logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real real .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to begin to turn the real world into play .
my inspiration comes from an event that <unk> 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
these fantastic <unk> were <unk> .
and these were the first one of people developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek <unk> <unk> , you may know that story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , games were actually invented in the kingdom of <unk> during famine .
supposedly , there was such great famine that the king of <unk> decided to do a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and a national strategy , a national strategy , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be , very , very much in the <unk> where games are so fascinating and with <unk> , <unk> productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would be eating .
and according to <unk> , they survive so 18 years of starvation , by eating them on a day and playing them on a day .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games in order to get out of the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games in order to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not satisfying in the real life , and we &apos;re going to bring what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
the <unk> was not better for 18 years , so the king decided not better . so the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> , and the winner were allowed to break a <unk> adventure .
she left <unk> , and they went to search for a new home , and they just had so many people coming back to the survival , and they were looking for the rest of an area where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> shows that the <unk> , which later , later the roman empire , have the same dna as the old <unk> .
and so scientists came to the notion that <unk> &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> , which was almost 20 years , which was going to explain famine .
so this crazy story might be true .
you may actually have saved their people through play , by having <unk> for 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> and so much about playing with each other , that they had saved the entire civilization .
so we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 warcraft .
this was the first <unk> of the world of <unk> , which was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should have <unk> that half of us spend an hour a day with games , until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the world &apos;s real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly the question i &apos;ve done my work in the last few years to the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , and it expresses out how to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to make the best possible outcome , and then people will empower people to implement this idea into reality .
we think we &apos;ll be epic won , and we give people the opportunities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very quickly , three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and get people to get to get people in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough <unk> to make it realistic for them , and they actually live in the real life without oil , so if you sign up to the game , you &apos;ll tell you how much oil is affected , whether it &apos;s not food food , and you have to figure out how much oil is .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and i said , &quot; we go out of oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you go on .
find out how they were going to survive , most of our players who are doing <unk> behavior .
so what we &apos;ve got to do for the next <unk> game is a bigger target than <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game called <unk> at the institute of the future .
the point is that the computation is a <unk> that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to the player to sign up , we designed almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know , jerry <unk> , where there &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google &quot; <unk> &quot; .
and the last game we put out on the third of march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you finish the game , you get the world bank award for &quot; social <unk> &quot; by 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa , and invite them to learn social design .
we have a comic book . we &apos;ve got &quot; level high &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> that will benefit from their own social enterprises , to save the world .
now i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that the players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to knit close social nets , <unk> , and demand for <unk> .
i really hope that we play meaningful games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me .
i &apos;m sure in two things in the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create each of the future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i was writing about a few months ago in writing a article for <unk> wired .
i &apos;m always writing my <unk> at the time , but i &apos;ve been working with the work of text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never had my life in my life , which really means &quot; disabled . &quot;
i &apos;m reading the post .
&quot; disabled , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , lo and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend loud , and i had to laugh at it , it didn &apos;t work so ridiculous , but i just got up to read , and i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading after that <unk> and <unk> shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought it has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i started to build elementary school , and started to build my sense of self outside of my family context , and to shape , in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
if i &apos;m going to take this post seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life can run positive , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the odds and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i &apos;ve immediately navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and i expect me to find a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words in the last two words under &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the romans , have really believed that the pronunciation has a great force , because what you can get out loud , it can also <unk> .
so , what do we actually want to do -- one disabled person or a powerful person ?
to call a human being as a child as a child , it might be enough , <unk> , <unk> them .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ?
a human being opened for me was my pediatrician at <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t tell , so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. <unk> was always very colorful , and it was just for children to work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital was just great -- to my <unk> .
and i had to hate individual practice with this big , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know to build my <unk> , and i hated these on a little more than anything . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine , in fact , i &apos;ve actually negotiate with dr. p. child with dr. p. and trying to stop this exercise , <unk> without success .
and one day , he was watching me with one of my practice -- these things were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , <unk> and young girl , you &apos;re going to just tear one of these tapes .
and if you make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was , of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that richest five-year-old girl in the ward of a second , but he actually got me to see my daily <unk> girl in the ward of the second .
and i ask myself today , how much his vision was shaped as strong and <unk> young girls , and i could imagine , as one of nature from strong , powerful and <unk> human .
that &apos;s just one example of how adults can encourage the imagination of a child .
but as that already <unk> examples of the <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t make us space , to imagine what we all would want to do , to allow every single one to see themselves as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes , which has been triggered in many cases through a technological change .
of course , in the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the <unk> of titan , <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for the aging body that allows people to really use their own ability and set up on the limits that they set up their own own ability to speak out , and give them a single identity in their own way .
so , perhaps this technological change actually illustrates that there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human society can make something very powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability can adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me how to do with <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m going to feel very uncomfortable with this , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with this , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with this .
this sentence from the deal with <unk> lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge to be shaped without being shaped by the experience of a prosthetic experience , as though my life could be so successful because i could perceive the potential of a life with a prosthetic .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing , of course , of course , we have been shaped by the challenge , whether they physically , emotionally , or even both .
and i claim that it &apos;s good .
<unk> is not a obstacle that we need to be able to get away with our lives better .
<unk> are just in our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly seeing , but he &apos;s all the time with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact of the <unk> , or the <unk> of a human being .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real , and every person is different with it , but the question is not whether we come from <unk> or not , but how we can do that .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve <unk> , but they also prepare for them to be clear .
and we don &apos;t turn to our children , if we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you have to separate two things that are the medical fact , to be an amputee , and to the other social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability , which i had to put up with apart , is that the world is constantly , it could be the world that i could describe to .
in our wish to protect the people who are at the heart of the heart and to communicate the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction , or to put even a prediction to the quality of life that you expect , we need to be careful that we &apos;re not having a set of people .
and maybe this is the right concept , which is just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we repair the repair , for each one greater disability than the pathology &apos;s office .
if we don &apos;t holistically treating a human being , and not all of its forces and opportunities and recognize , we also create to the natural struggle that you might have to do , another disease .
we have a person who has value for our society .
so we have to focus on the <unk> and look at all of the human opportunities .
but the most important thing is that it &apos;s between perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> .
we shouldn &apos;t do those <unk> times or either , we should not try to avoid them , we should go , we should return them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about seeing the most important opportunity .
i think it &apos;s more likely to make sure that we &apos;re not necessarily going to have to go through , but we &apos;re open to embracing them on the <unk> , and put them on the <unk> , and perhaps even dance with it .
and perhaps we can do it as a natural , <unk> and useful and feel useful and feel like that in the presence of their presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . the birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , has pointed out to something very true in the human character .
i would call it this way , not the most powerful of its species , and also not the <unk> of its species , but the one that changes the best changes .
from conflict comes creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and <unk> , from the struggle of the human mind is to turn itself through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of humans .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re carved from , if we &apos;re really tested .
potentially , that &apos;s the point of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> are for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think that the biggest damage we &apos;ve been presented to ourselves is to believe we should be normal .
let &apos;s face it , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the common common . the typical . but not the normal one , and would you know that poor , gray person really familiar if they really would have ?
i think rather than not .
it would be great if we can do this paradigm against another one of the possibilities , or the strength , to make it even a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces from very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills in society .
we found out that we have always found people from members of our society to be useful and afford a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that already the neanderthals from 60,000 years ago , and people have worn people with heavy physical injuries , and perhaps , because the <unk> of these people were valuable for society .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may hardly remember me .
when i first saw her , i got her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that .
and then , of course , it &apos;s done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i knew from narratives of my mother &apos;s day , because i was , of course , very typical to my birthday two weeks late to my birthday .
so the doctor for medical diagnostics in my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had been looking at them , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other hand , he had the <unk> , which had to deliver bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never would be <unk> like other kids or that you could never have an independent life , and then they just lie <unk> . &quot;
and i found that he had collected my entire childhood <unk> , no matter if i had won the <unk> in the second grade in the second grade , whether i was on the <unk> of <unk> at <unk> , no matter whether i had a scholarship or a designer &apos;s <unk> , and he used these snippets to teach his students .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor can be the quality of life &apos;s quality of life .
and dr. <unk> said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if you don &apos;t always say anything else , and even if you get children in a little bit , if you get kids on themselves , children can do a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone manage it , are two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve got my thinking over time , if you had asked me at the age of 15 , if i had <unk> my <unk> legs from meat and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second <unk> .
i really wanted to work normal then .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and this is happening because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people that opened me to the doors , instead of getting people to cut me up , to cut me up to an idea .
you see , it really takes a person who shows you how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow anyone to activate your own inner forces , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and you open up a door for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open yourself .
the real meaning of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential to <unk> .
again , what potential do we do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , a case study was done , and then <unk> were transformed in <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided by grades .
and that a student are getting <unk> harder , getting better teachers .
and then you &apos;ve got a <unk> period of time to students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; note , &quot; they said they were very clever , they were very smart , and after that three months they &apos;ve been written .
and of course , it breaks the heart to hear , the other way to the other point was said , they &apos;re just enough .
and it was the same after the three months .
but only those who are still at school -- except for the students who had thrown the school .
the key to this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that these are the <unk> , and those are the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they treat them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind that has been broken , doesn &apos;t have any hope . it &apos;s missing no more <unk> that we &apos;re missing our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability to imagination .
but if we do it , to support the human mind , to be hoping to be hoping to find themselves and other people around themselves , just curious and <unk> , and then we put our forces truly positive .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and i told my friend jacques <unk> . and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows just four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows , not the god of the name . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said that by a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more accurate .
or do you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
do you want to get more attractive and more confident ?
what would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who have been doing more and more creativity .
what would you most like ?
which would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to do a good memory ?
a couple more .
what about fitness would be ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do that as a doctor .
if you could have just one of them , it would be a very different world .
is that all a fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor &apos;s view .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox orthodox church , wrote an essay called &quot; none in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not accepting the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good moment to turn your <unk> out , take your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at the kathryn <unk> &apos; book , because nothing in this talk will be wrong .
but if you accept biological evolution , remember this : is it just about the past , or is it all about the future ?
is it for others , or does it matter ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the margins of the tree of life , all existing <unk> on the <unk> of these branches have success : they have survived ; it &apos;s demonstrated its environment , fitness .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is of course what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branches from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some of them come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we were right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually the biggest part , the basic mechanisms of our cells are quite equal to our cells .
do you realize that we can pull out of it and make the mechanisms of any bacteria to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat the <unk> of the diabetic .
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> of what comes out of the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about bacteria is aware that each of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads to the rest of the body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , remember , think if antonio damasio asks , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> ; it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that you could only want to do without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way of bacteria , with occasional <unk> of unintended fake , <unk> forced push .
but else , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for your life .
they &apos;re helping the digestion of <unk> nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
or are we going to become something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back into the time of the big bang big , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about a half and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species , which is perhaps so much as 800 or a billion years ago .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is only as soon as well as a single <unk> , the animal kingdom , like a single <unk> , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that was us .
now this is also the <unk> of this speech , so i hope there &apos;s a lot of it like that .
now , when i was a <unk> in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i posed something very fundamental , which is very fundamental , in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue to both <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms showed up , things began to change .
<unk> reproduction in the picture .
and it &apos;s very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that &apos;s going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of death in the same moment as the sexual reproduction in the same time is reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has come to my increasing doubt .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who in las vegas was <unk> the show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat in his <unk> .
he opens the door .
in front of him , there &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a doctor that was very different from the purpose of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , just a different way .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the relationship with the genome of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , it &apos;s and i developed as <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of the orbit , to drop into the sea .
i think we would all have the mood , the woody allen , the woody allen , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to immortality through my work .
i want to do it by going not to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily <unk> , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
now , on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and they &apos;re going to survive the hot steam , if fish are there , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum cook , and yet they &apos;ve managed to make a vacuum that there &apos;s a <unk> environment .
so , what is that , when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space , people in evolution , and most of all , as we go back into evolution , and i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to move .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for this would be that it &apos;s been done by medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that had otherwise been <unk> and from the population removed from the population .
and second , we as a species , we have a species so focused on our environment that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to ourselves , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and create and create so much that they can no longer say that isolation is necessary for the evolution of evolution .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , on the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of the evolution is slow , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far , the isolation is when we cover a distance as a species , it will be insulation and the changes of the environment that evolution could produce in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , amazing and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new progression that isn &apos;t simply , of course , but led to us as <unk> in the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
so let &apos;s look at the reality that people are doing today in some cultures in some cultures .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so think , if it &apos;s not just possible to be able to choose your child &apos;s gender , but also to make genetic adaptations to cure disease and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic change to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or reduce the risk of cancer or strokes ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it in your genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year , when it finished 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the room for about a week .
it &apos;s not going to be a long time to be the reality that there &apos;s going to be the 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
before a week ago , the national academy of engineering prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , who developed the natural process of the natural process of making the natural process of evolution , to work faster , in a more efficient way -- which <unk> arnold calls &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the artist <unk> <unk> was awarded to his research where he took an adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes , induced them to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell potentially able to be able to get in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can produce human insulin in bacteria that are not only protection of themselves , but it can serve for the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in gang with <unk> <unk> that has been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good about tobacco ?
this is all reality today and in the future will be much more possible .
so just imagine two different little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change that sperm and <unk> or your fresh egg , in order to give your kids a better chance to give your kids a better chance of life -- eliminating the diabetes , the risk of cancer reducing ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine in science that can enable the change to prevent disease , could also allow us to say , allow us to adopt <unk> , <unk> , the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of a ken <unk> , especially if you can expand the next generation of <unk> ?
why does not have fast <unk> that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life ?
these will be <unk> .
and if we are at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be converted to <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires maybe 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with those of their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better than the more successful is more friendly ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want to do for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to be able to form a society and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to be facing .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we will need to make these decisions ?
in good like evil , and you may think that these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to introduce you to now , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another thing that helps you get up and go back and go .
so at berkeley , we call this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing different than something that you put it in the morning , and it gives them extra strength , and that will increase your velocity , and help them continue to balance .
that &apos;s actually the real <unk> of human and machine .
but not just that -- it goes together and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the demand that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help cope with this problem .
so let me introduce you to now <unk> -- or from universal <unk> <unk> .
soldier : with that <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds over <unk> terrain for many hours .
the flexible design allows you to do it deep down to where they &apos;re going deep and highly selective movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and get my strength and persistence .
we are at the way that we have to introduce our <unk> this device , this new <unk> project in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our look at the wheelchair wheelchair , something that i &apos;m passionate about , especially passionate .
there are 68 million people around the world valued in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a lot of young people with spinal cord injury in the <unk> of their lives -- 20s , &apos; 30s -- by the fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , their number multiplied .
and pretty much the only option , if it comes to a <unk> , or about other complications , is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since the way i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the field .
now let me introduce you to <unk> , which is carried by amanda <unk> , who suffered from an age of 19 years ago that they couldn &apos;t walk over for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors on crutches , the signals on our <unk> , which is attached to its back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , and the <unk> is on their hips , as well as on their <unk> , which are moving forward to this fairly <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , i was <unk> as a <unk> .
i lost every feeling in a fraction of a second , and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor in my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never be able to go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every hopeful hope of my consciousness .
i &apos;ve got <unk> technologies since i &apos;ve been learning , to learn to ski , and to drive even the hands .
but nothing was invented for me to let me go again .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got all the potential here to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or amanda here and <unk> , but for everyone .
thank you .
home in new york , i &apos;m ceo of the <unk> of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i didn &apos;t get the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteer <unk> .
now , in our city , in the volunteer volunteers , you &apos;ve got to be pretty early on the <unk> to be able to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
and i was the second volunteer for <unk> , so i had a pretty good opportunity to go in there .
but it was still a races against the other volunteers to reach the <unk> of <unk> and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had a very serious conversation with the <unk> who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the <unk> and barefoot , under a screen under a screen in <unk> , while her house was burned .
the other volunteer that was close to me -- we call him <unk> luther -- got to go into the house first and asked to save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> envy .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who could tell the rest of his life for the rest of his life , that he was going into a <unk> house to save a living creature , just because he was about five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you &apos;ve got to go up to the top of the fire , and that woman must get some shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
now , not exactly what i hoped i &apos;d like , but i went to go up and down stairs , on the &quot; real &quot; <unk> , &quot; which had been <unk> at that moment , in the bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i carried my prey back down , where i met my <unk> in my <unk> and beloved dog .
we carrying our value out to the <unk> , where , not surprising , his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> got a letter to the <unk> , where they were <unk> for the brave commitment .
one of the things about everything is <unk> kindness : somebody had actually brought her some shoes .
and in my profession , in my profession , and in my <unk> , as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witness of generosity and kindness at big scale , but i also see the charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room , and i see people who have already reached an <unk> success or on their way , i want to offer that memory : don &apos;t wait .
not wait to make a difference in the life of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have to give something , let &apos;s give it right now .
use them in a <unk> room to put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we have a chance to save a human life , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so let &apos;s go . save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s humanity .
a place where women lead to the women who have sex with sex hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos , with chimpanzees , are our closest living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , living about six million years ago .
now , chimps are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees run by large , fear of <unk> , <unk> guys , is led by <unk> females .
they really came up with this , because this leads to a <unk> society in the fatal violence in the fatal violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known among the primates .
they live in the depths of the <unk> , and they &apos;re just hard to use it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent argument , which has been <unk> and almost so many lives in world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also survive survival of the bonobos .
<unk> and the decline in the <unk> are going to be filling up a <unk> <unk> -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules such as conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos are more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their life .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , it &apos;s a little bit of a game for the relationship of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
and play increases in creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of connections , diversity of connections .
and when you see bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique footage out of the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think of <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this may be the evolutionary origin : &quot; she grabs him with eggs . &quot;
just i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both by bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> where you bring new elements to the game -- like the <unk> -- and as it does , in the same time , it &apos;s fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of forms that some calm down , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i &apos;d like to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she is playing peacefully .
and i think exactly how they play , sometimes , and we &apos;re <unk> limitations of our inner and outside worlds .
and it &apos;s these playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact , and the unexpected wiring that we form are the real breeding ground .
this is just a little <unk> in the insights , the bonobos <unk> us in our past and present .
but it also is a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , by greater creativity , and educational resources .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to make us succeed in the world , we need to play .
but will we make the best out of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people , equally , it doesn &apos;t exist in teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe a game seems to play .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and playing together , as we can play the creativity of <unk> and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to take two pairs in the middle of the middle , in the middle of 1979 , at exactly the same day , every <unk> baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to have too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you think of all the time , you &apos;re not listening to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case that &apos;s called a y <unk> , which hits the x chromosome in the <unk> .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome in the <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both fire .
we get back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two statements .
under a hat , i &apos;m in the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m a lot of <unk> , and in this case , i study people with anatomy -- that means human body , animal body -- like them with <unk> <unk> , as they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i &apos;ve carried in my work is the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say sometimes , as impatient lawyer -- by people who are the patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms in the question .
so for example , i worked with people who are twins , two people in a body .
i worked with <unk> people -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people , whose gender <unk> -- so people who have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the kinds of <unk> , which are in the male or female standard .
so in one case , you may have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y makes the <unk> gene , which we &apos;ve all got at <unk> &apos;s stage .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are on the <unk> stage testosterone .
but because this individual doesn &apos;t have the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body does not respond to testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no response .
as a consequence , the body is developing more the overall female process .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
but it &apos;s mostly when they reached puberty , and their breasts grow and evolve , but it doesn &apos;t get their period , until someone gets there something different .
and they &apos;re doing a couple of tests and find out that instead of <unk> and uterus , in fact , it &apos;s testes , and they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that this person could actually hold the male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , they have something called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me are actually talking about <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
and the result is that someone like me actually a brain that was exposed to more <unk> than a woman who was born with testicles , and has a <unk> .
so sex is really complicated ; <unk> are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be spread across the entire bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call call a 19 years ago , who was when boy was born , he had a friend , had sex with his friend , living as a man , and he had just found that he had <unk> and had a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his field was so deeply active , that they basically made a male <unk> .
and as a result , its <unk> male . his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody could see something .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he <unk> the doctors that the doctors found that he was inside the inside .
okay , just a quick example of a variant of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , which is something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different ways .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or identical twins , it was often adapted to the norm , is not because of the physical health of advantage would be .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often made different surgeries to them is because they threaten our social categories .
it typically is based our system on the idea that it &apos;s a certain amount of anatomical expression with a particular identity .
so we have the concept of being a woman is called a female identity , called a black person , is supposedly supposedly , to have african anatomy in terms of history .
so we &apos;ve got this awful <unk> idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that is actually something very different for us , and it confused us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , the two people are in a body .
where i had experienced most of the time in time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> last year , whose sex had been asked in berlin in berlin .
many journalists , a lot of journalists call me the question , &quot; what &apos;s test you will do , that tells us whether <unk> <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain a journalist that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender enough is enough to admit that nature is not <unk> with the male and female , or between the male and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
so we have a situation like that , where the further our science goes forward , we need to admit that these categories that we &apos;ve thought we were doing for having very simple <unk> categories , which are very simple <unk> to create sustained <unk> than we &apos;ve thought .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it also is true of race , which it turns out to be a lot more complicated than our <unk> has allowed .
we &apos;re at the same time with ourselves , we get into all sorts of places .
so , for example , we push that at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re going to tell ourselves a little bit of a little bit of different sources ?
as we keep our science further forward , we come increasingly into a <unk> zone , where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the <unk> , in our culture today , is the struggle for the beginning and the end of life , and the end of life .
we have a difficult conversation about what a body is going to be to humans , so that he &apos;s a very different right than fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question of someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors had never had so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
they just kept a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they didn &apos;t bury them .
if they weren &apos;t moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we take people out of people &apos;s organs and want them to transplant other people .
and as a result , we caught ourselves in the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation we don &apos;t have as simple categories as i used to .
now , if you would assume that the whole thing they would do from categories like me was really happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , is tense .
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i &apos;ve got to say first that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , what they did , all of the years of doing the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened with the <unk> .
so the founding fathers were from my view of the original <unk> activists , which is why .
what she was doing was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers from the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the ancient world had no idea based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who have political power , that political power should have , because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the grandfather &apos;s father and so on .
so the founding fathers back to this idea and they were taking them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all of the people were created on the same .
so she <unk> the field of field , and decided that <unk> , the common count , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things were in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time also grew science .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , clearly that many of you are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , and meadows things , like a supernatural concept of power , back to where the transmission of a very <unk> concept is based on a very <unk> process .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , she managed to get a concept of <unk> commonalities .
and so they &apos;ve really prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after that ?
for example , for example , the women who <unk> the <unk> , the concept of the founding fathers , that says there &apos;s both both more important than both of both of the important things , and they said , &quot; that we should not have one uterus and <unk> is not important enough that we should not have a difference , right ? &quot;
and women do succeed .
next , the successful civil rights movement , where we were seeing people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> line of the <unk> , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color that are <unk> in anatomical terms , again , successful .
and we see the same thing at <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we begin to look at all the similarities , we need to begin to wonder why we sustain certain <unk> .
now mind you , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish for a fish like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should fully take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have a right to get your informed consent to sex .
so there &apos;s some anatomical <unk> that make sense for me , and that we do , i think .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they make sense .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that were <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 at the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months <unk> , so she was born on june 1 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to the <unk> , so he was born on the last march .
just because of the fact that maria has been born three months of <unk> , you get all kinds of <unk> three months from <unk> -- to have the <unk> sex , the right to drink the right .
<unk> has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re finding others about what their rights are .
<unk> , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that it &apos;s the <unk> -- because you think that it &apos;s male , he can now move in , which maria really has to worry about .
but maria , not in all states , can &apos;t see the same right in all states , the <unk> in all states , has to marry that .
<unk> can get a woman in every state , but maria can only be married in a few states a woman .
so we have these <unk> categories that are difficult in many ways problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question for me is , what are we going to do , because our science in the anatomy is doing that we have a point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s based on anatomy , could be <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , it feels like science makes its own power .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture , a kind of pragmatic posture , assume , &quot; well , we need to go somewhere a line , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people were caught in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas , at a point , decided that to marry a man is that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and you get a woman to marry a woman , you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the history of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a solution .
he says we should not tell people , &quot; her color color , &quot; judge , &quot; judge , and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their <unk> ?
and i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to distribute rights in human beings , because i have to admit that i know a series of <unk> , which probably make benefits rather than some people i know .
i want to <unk> that i probably know some bright <unk> , which is <unk> , more intelligent and more mature decisions about their sexual relations than some of the things i know .
so how do we ask the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and part of me wonder what if the content of a personality would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- could be made through an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go into that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make thoughts about questions about democracy .
in our strive for democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , in iran , in iran , where a man who &apos;s attracted sexually to other men , it &apos;s actually drawn to the death , because he &apos;s willing to engage in a <unk> , which is it .
states of this species don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m glad to say that we didn &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago , who had had a couple of identical twins in order to separate them , part of making a name .
but when i was doing it with him , and he asked him why he did these surgeries -- it was a lot of <unk> surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these children were going to be treated very badly , and therefore he had to do it .
and i said to him , &quot; now you have political asylum , rather than any surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be that they are , without that they should change the state of state .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about how democracy might look like democracy might be , or looked if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something radical , which is radical , and that &apos;s what i think is that there could be different kinds of insights that are <unk> from different kinds of anatomy , <unk> when people apply a <unk> .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not each , but on average -- more complex social relations and care of people who are vulnerable to people who are vulnerable to the group .
and so , if we &apos;re thinking about this , we have an interesting situation .
a few years ago , when i did a graduate student , one of my favorite interest in feminism was to know my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so i &apos;m doing that -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> stereotypes about gender , that &apos;s why feminism is not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought there might be some <unk> of feminism .
this is supposed to be , there might be something , on average , making female brains of male , which makes female brains from male social relations , and <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding fathers were <unk> to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we <unk> more mothers in this concept , we have more concept , not just how to protect , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future , if we have to go to democracy about anatomy -- less to think about the individual bodies to think about identity and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to try to connect a <unk> connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find another opportunity to find a different <unk> , <unk> outfit , and photograph and blogging past .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment , and also my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my own dollars is usually a good purpose ; i look quite unique , and it &apos;s doing the kind of personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i was doing for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought .
i brought seven <unk> with me , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for just a week are everything i did in my suitcase .
i have bet i would have everything else i wanted to wear , if i came to palm springs .
and since you &apos;re not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around here in her underwear , which means i &apos;ve found some things .
and i want to show you my favorite week for this week .
it sounds good ?
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i do , whether you believe it or not , have learned out of these <unk> , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call the shining tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , had 55 cost , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s impossible not to be bad to be bad if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other lucky people .
tuesday : <unk> is totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to try to be myself and adapt me at the same time .
be just who you are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : embracing your child .
sometimes people say to me , i would say , like i do dress , or i remember her seven-year-olds .
i like smile , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they don &apos;t look good in something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll just summarize that for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re a wonderful person on the inside , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anybody here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit too .
and ultimately , saturday : one of their own , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world a little bit about one , without saying a word .
it was always proven to me , and again , when people came up to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;ll donate it all over again .
because the lesson i try and learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to get rid of it .
i don &apos;t have to think of these things , because in the same way around the corner , there &apos;s always another crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just wait for me is waiting for a little bit of love and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon all together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as <unk> as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m also italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in italy , but the reason i &apos;m going to show you this is something very interesting in the formula for one over the past decades .
some time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula one race , you took the budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , today , you need if you want a race to win , in fact , something like this -- something that has a car in real time , a couple of thousands of sensors that have information from the car , this information to the system , and then use it to make things go back and use things in real time .
they would call this , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> begin to appear in our lives .
our cities were equipped in the last few years just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to become a computer in free .
and as a computer in free , they start to respond to other ways , and they &apos;re perceived and powered .
and when we go to cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
and by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this sense and power in the everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli at moma later , in the summer , in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called . &quot;
now all of our objects , our environment , are starting to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom is out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is changing radically the interaction that we humans have out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means that he took the hammer , and he threw him on the end of moses , actually , you can still see a little bit of <unk> -- and why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well today , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , to perceive our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the vision .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first our labs .
there &apos;s been a four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we did , actually , was actually a new kind of network that was used around the world -- this is a <unk> -- and blind and <unk> information from this network that will be collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the <unk> won .
some of you remember it was played in italy as italy , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
and anyway , in italy by the end won .
now look at what happened on this day , just when the activity has happened in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
tomorrow , in front of the game .
you &apos;re looking at the timeline .
in the past afternoon , people here , and there , the calls are making and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy is a gateway .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second <unk> . end of the normal play .
first extension , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy . yeah .
well , that night , all went to celebrate .
they saw the great key .
the next day , everyone went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then all the down .
you &apos;re looking at the picture of the space , <unk> <unk> , where the roman roman has been going to go to celebrate , and to have a big party , and they see the key thing at the end of the day .
now , that &apos;s just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way , in a way we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
so , again , another example of life : this is not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well today , we know all about where our things are coming .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computers , how they came together .
but we know just a little bit about where things go .
so in this project we actually designed some small markers to track the garbage while it &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that started us , a little more than a year ago , to tag on the things that they can see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away anyway .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the trash and started tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with that information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s going to happen a lot of <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that when we see every day , the cup that we throw away , not simply disappears , that it &apos;s still on the planet somewhere .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we show that people , then we can drive change behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could give you much more about the vision and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive with , but i &apos;d like to be able to talk to the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition to use in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were going on in a <unk> <unk> , imagine these tubes , and valves , <unk> , valves , who open up and close .
it causes something like a <unk> <unk> of water .
if they fall off these days , you can write about patterns , you can see patterns , images , text .
and you can approach it , and it will open up , and it &apos;s going to be opening up , as you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it really liked it .
and we got the assignment to design a building at the entrance to design the expo .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and get it in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy windy if you want to reduce this syringes , you can actually leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and become the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , that day when you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you have destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t kill the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost goes away .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me , when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water to get wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night than all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was more fun at that night .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them one , but a building that &apos;s still silence and holes in the water , you had to jump off without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , think about how people are using things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that will be used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , <unk> of water and the projection .
and this is what made us think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that <unk> could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> light with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier with others , in completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display like this -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , in three dimensions , in which what changes , the light is not the position of <unk> .
they can play with various species .
imagine that in front of the screen just could appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud from <unk> , which you can walk around and through which you move through , many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , which <unk> to form a <unk> v .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this , so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person &apos;s being controlled .
it could have every single one of them in a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or so on .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and <unk> in milan -- we took his movements in 3d -- to use it as a impulse to <unk> .
here you see <unk> dancing .
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the <unk> , they can play with the color of gravity and playing <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a possible impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we work on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympic games in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and so , again , the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going back to people again to do something and change the environment -- almost like we call it <unk> , as you move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everyone can give a donation for a donation .
i think the remarkable thing about what happened last decades , the last decades , is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world to a digital world .
so this has digitized all , knowledge , and power to the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the campaign obama was showing that -- we can change from the digital world to change the <unk> forces of the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us the coming challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical world .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they do things together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way as a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s an engineering device in london , but with <unk> .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 , and also sharing it as the connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top , like london &apos;s new <unk> .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital <unk> at night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for all of you who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , it &apos;s very important to me .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i first saw my first <unk> .
i was <unk> awe .
my heart hit , i was <unk> , while i was trying to summarize what was in front of me .
the <unk> around me was almost 60 meters in the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year by year .
now , <unk> are born as a calf or <unk> out of <unk> .
each iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact in distinct ways with their own experiences , and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and they &apos;re going to end up to the bitter end , whereas others can &apos;t withstand it and go into a <unk> passion .
when you look at an iceberg , you &apos;re easily thinking that you &apos;re isolated , separate and alone , as we see humans often .
but the truth is far away .
while an iceberg melts , i put up his <unk> atmosphere .
while the iceberg melting <unk> drinking water that feeds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to take my footage out of this <unk> as if i &apos;m going to make portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness , that in that individual moments , you &apos;re going to exist in that individual moments , and never come back .
it &apos;s not a death when it melt ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s a <unk> of your <unk> along the life cycle .
a part of the ice in the middle of the ice that i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i have in <unk> greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to be witnessed a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
you look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , he starts roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it spike about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , it gives you another side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is truly blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but what i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leaders of the 1980s .
then one day he came from walking and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood with him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , and so graffiti is just a complex part of what we admire and look at the art world .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , that &apos;s not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
anybody saw the movie &apos; butterfly and <unk> ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along .
i said , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need just to <unk> just a check , and instead i had the <unk> check that i didn &apos;t have the <unk> idea how i was supposed to <unk> him .
and i kept connecting with his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony &apos;s going to talk : we &apos;ll talk to him , and we &apos;ll find a way to get a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce of a farce that someone who &apos;s all wearing it in it , it can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
so i spoke for a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows you to project any light on any surface , and then to draw a <unk> on any surface , which is just the negative surface .
so they &apos;re moving around and make <unk> like this .
they say all things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the genital organs , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and finally people make art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home and ate my wife with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , so that he would be able to use your eyes , that would be great . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot from things , we &apos;ve done some things .
first of all , we &apos;ve got the insurance companies to <unk> the doors , and they actually get a device for <unk> to communicate with it -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it <unk> , because you &apos;re talking to him , or gets an email , and think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all corners of the world -- literally from all corners of the world .
my wife , my kids , and i went into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful to do that , and that we were <unk> and all of the images on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programming , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids were involved , and we created this one .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of venice , some <unk> and a couple of things from the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , you have <unk> , they put them on a <unk> , and now we &apos;ve got a device that is free -- you can build it yourself , we can download the code for free , the software you can download .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limitations .
you can &apos;t insurance .
not a hospital .
every <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes , or drawing his eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
this is all of these <unk> before the great revelation .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony <unk> , tony for the first time .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he sees his life support system .
we have his bed down to see it outside .
we set up a projector against a wall of the <unk> in front of the hospital .
and he did again for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling was in the parking lot .
so we also had to <unk> in the parking lot , so we felt as a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he would send us an email with this content , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel like i was pushing under water , and i finally got somebody down down and raised my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t overwhelming ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that holds us on the shelf and we continue to develop .
and we need to improve a lot more about this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
and someone who has such a <unk> potential deserve so much .
so we &apos;re about to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , this is honored to us as one of the great best innovations in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of it is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that this april , <unk> <unk> in the inner-city of los angeles , is going to be an exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there will be quite the toughest representative of the <unk> here -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty straightforward .
so basically , i &apos;m like , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this computer , the <unk> , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you &apos;re all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with <unk> , but i &apos;ve just got something together , and surrounded me with amazing people , so we could put something on the legs .
and that question should each one of you , and every single day where you noticed something that has to get done , if not now , when not i ? and if not me , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most often <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come out like a scientist .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , the enlightenment , it &apos;s usually something that you find because you dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block , and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle then began in the &apos; 60s at the time in <unk> , ohio where i was the <unk> .
i was the one that was beaten every week in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the <unk> .
they would secretly secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to get a work on <unk> .
so , about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , a woman post , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned to each other as adults .
please come to ohio , and please come together with the man , which i know you &apos;ve found it .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to be a hurry . &quot;
well the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we took them around them , and we gave eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted me to learn as adults , to met me , she turned into a box full of ash and became put in my hands .
what was happening was that the circle was closed , it became a circle -- and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she has saved my life , and my partner and i &apos;ve been rescued .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is what i &apos;ve been talking about here today .
it takes the same -- it takes , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while you go up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a power plant , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
that sounds fear .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at it in the same way , and they said , &quot; no problem , we might have caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already <unk> , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
it switches the <unk> .
so think of an airplane an airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to hit . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , it was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned in this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to pass a hand , and not doing it , all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did .
while i was thinking about it , i noticed a saying that says , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is far , and the person is there , then i open him .
i never want to move something in life .
and this urgency , the goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> the george washington bridge , pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to do better to become better in everything i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego .
and i &apos;m <unk> the time that i have to have for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to my friends .
and after that , when i was thinking , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i don &apos;t have two years to <unk> me with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have , right . i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned was -- while the internal watch <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ...
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , not terrifying .
it &apos;s almost like we would prepare for our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really <unk> in one thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i wish i could grow my children up .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ...
not yet .
and i &apos;m going to cry like a little kid .
and in the world everything made sense to me .
i realized at that time by having the dots , that it &apos;s just about being a great father in life .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life to be a good dad .
i became the miracle of the wonder of this day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and to live differently .
my call to all that fly today is , imagine the same thing on your flight -- please not -- but think about it , but how would you change ?
what would you do that they <unk> , because they think they were always there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only do ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we can do it , the systems of <unk> that control and the valves , we can actually get a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we make it that an effective <unk> is used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning of <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will go into the gray box , damage the centrifuge , the iranian <unk> <unk> -- mission accomplished .
that &apos;s a simple thing , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started our research on <unk> six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the meaning and purpose of this .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the <unk> part , the <unk> part , he made by <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
and it seemed to be a little bit <unk> with these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment with <unk> , and studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> was like a <unk> that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> off , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that doesn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to think that this is a <unk> attack .
based on a particular destination .
<unk> <unk> active on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program that &apos;s trying to infect it on this goal .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything at all .
so , it really got my interest , and we started working with this , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , say , for example , an <unk> american power station , or being a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> we found the <unk> code , and they found that it &apos;s <unk> in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional , by people who obviously had all the <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that had to attack them .
probably , they probably knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard already , the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> is a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like an ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so , what we were looking at first was <unk> <unk> , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring them to the real world -- the potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or disprove .
and to make these theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and very likely it &apos;s in iran , because most infections were reported there .
now , in this area there isn &apos;t several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically going out to the <unk> nuclear power plant , and in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and <unk> her knowledge to compare your expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
there &apos;s a moving part of this moving part in the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this <unk> , then you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor there , and eventually you can actually explode the centrifuge .
and what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , to make it slowly and spooky -- obviously , trying to make <unk> despair , so that you don &apos;t want to be able to get to it quickly .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of that by looking at very carefully and <unk> .
so , for example , the number <unk> is very , very <unk> , you can &apos;t miss it .
i started with scientific literature on how these <unk> were built in <unk> , and found that they &apos;re <unk> in what &apos;s called <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it became better .
these <unk> in iran are divided in 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost identical .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t just like this .
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
and we just ran into a dead <unk> , and we had to get to them .
but anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and slow them down and slow it and the big <unk> starts with six <unk> into the interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have to have what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be made by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- made me out of socks .
the gray box at the bottom is the gray box , and on top , you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the flow of the forces of sensors -- so for example of <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s available to be available as the attack , with false energy data , it &apos;s going .
and in fact , this false forces are taken data from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> is fed by <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just , the <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more violent .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human brain can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , in a power station , for example , if the big <unk> is getting too fast , you have to open up in milliseconds of milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if those are at risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the <unk> , the <unk> will notice it .
this is frightening .
but it gets even worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work very well -- in a power station or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we &apos;ve seen it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most vulnerable environments .
we have to put the consequences , and we &apos;re going to prepare better for ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , there &apos;s been a lot of it that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that too ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yes . okay .
in my opinion , it &apos;s involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you that you have a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years trying to place me in situations which usually are very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i was filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days talking about food here -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to most of my career in this seem to be exposed to <unk> situations , and all of this for the attempt to study social activity that they &apos;re compelling and interesting is , and hopefully , in a way , what it does for the audience fun and accessible .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i &apos;d do something a little different .
some of you may have heard about it a couple of weeks ago in ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i would send out some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , a couple of happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , have got this unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let me buy -- the <unk> of the talk , which you &apos;re seeing right now , who had no title at that moment , not a lot of content .
so what you got was this : her name presents here : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and then the content of the ears ever could fly , especially when i keep stupid in your involvement .
but besides , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone into a couple of terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could get so hard to anything that difficult and as dangerous as with these guys into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything from up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , completely with brands that you see in the film , that &apos;s the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to suggest .
it was in eternity forever .
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x , but we will make sure that we will sell any possible category in the movie .
maybe we &apos;re selling a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car that they &apos;ve ever had , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , an awareness of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing you that brands are part of life , actually , to get you to finance the movie ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to be able to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it will be hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth doing a lot of really <unk> brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might see a <unk> of a <unk> .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is most likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a tough thing about the movie or a difficult thing to me ?
jk : both .
... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about the brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people that you have to do with ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; if the camera would mean , &quot; would we want to have a <unk> .
it turns out that it meant that it meant to be , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so , all these companies disappeared , one after another .
no one wanted to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising is to present your product as many people as possible , so many people are going to see as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media and the <unk> media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting sense of life that makes that message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and this was the following .
actually , no , that was not the mistake .
that would have no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you look transparency at the <unk> , this -- this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and <unk> , just to explore and <unk> ; it &apos;s immediately understood ; characterized by <unk> and access to information , especially , in particular , the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but as far as it comes to be done , it &apos;s going to change something .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear that still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else &apos;s risky ?
a whole dish cool <unk> food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me in lying -- and there he is sitting and look at me -- he &apos;s looking at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s just a company , an agency , to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to go to the <unk> , right with my team to the companies .
so what they suddenly began to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i &apos;ve got friends who make great , giant <unk> , and i have friends that are <unk> like me .
and my friends who do great , giant <unk> , say that the reason why their movies are so successful at the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends say that little <unk> are doing , &quot; well , how do we compete with this big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how do we see you in the movie ?
whenever i go on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see you you see you <unk> .
and every time i <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ? you &apos;re a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so you might have to be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we &apos;re offering one of these <unk> <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped both for men and women -- solid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can all answer their questions and give you an explicit version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you were talking about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other technologies .
so doing things like this -- you know , <unk> people -- that &apos;s kind of what we &apos;re interested in .
what kind of words would you describe ?
you &apos;re <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone is doing under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category makes a positive positive power , as opposed to <unk> and humidity . &quot;
it holds you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , <unk> .
so these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , which are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love really like beautiful clothing .
80s , &apos; 80s hit <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style that i have is &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many <unk> and stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry , and such a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes <unk> .
the brand two : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : partly in hippie , yogi <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> across the country worldwide .
so i think this is my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man four : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often look at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who really might help me understand what you call the <unk> .
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , helped to discover these <unk> .
if they were able to do it , they could also help me .
you brought their pictures , right ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit like that with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who forms my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so .
all of these things came and start from a place , and for me , they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that about the thoughts and feelings about you ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do they do ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what <unk> are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
it &apos;s a little bit more about you that aren &apos;t you .
what more <unk> did they go through ?
it doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be made .
and there are a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their <unk> two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength rather than both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re not sure , you &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they turn them into a positive , and it actually turn them into something positive .
what other brands act like this ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , wii called mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands , and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if anybody would ask you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , how would you ?
you know ? are you something that makes your blood in <unk> ?
or are you more like a <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , more quiet , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh ways of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and agile and agile and agile , <unk> , magic and <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> , like <unk> ?
are you established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionately as oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , safe , holy and way the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , the up and <unk> , and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they were not going to be part of the project .
they wanted to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but will have found 17 <unk> who were willing to get rid of these control who wanted to do business with somebody who are doing business and playful playful like me , and eventually to tell stories that we don &apos;t normally have told -- stories that would never normally support .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story of this film that you &apos;re using these days to <unk> the <unk> of the brain , both about advertising and movies .
we went to sao paulo where <unk> is banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no posters , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we drove in school districts where companies are going to their way to <unk> schools , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i have things directly with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said the agencies may not really be interested in meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people will think about thinking that the world will challenge .
and what was that for you ? what successful ?
now , there &apos;s the film called the <unk> film , we can look at this .
according to <unk> , the first time in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
that &apos;s actually just a period of two and two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not <unk> .
there &apos;s no time online , no <unk> .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , then the film had a very big momentum to this .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , which is almost every <unk> that we were talking about , their clients who recommended the fingers of it .
something that i believe in belief is that if you &apos;re taking a chance to pull out the risks , that in those risks that they &apos;re in .
i think if you stop people from it , you get them to fail .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risk , you &apos;re prepared for a profit to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to go into risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that they might be <unk> .
finally , in progress , we should welcome to the fear .
we should be the bear in the cage .
you welcome fear . you welcome the risk .
a big spoon full of the way that we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever , it takes us a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you welcome transparency , i was presented by my good friends of <unk> <unk> for <unk> on ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world in major opportunities .
<unk> presents , &quot; you welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you very much .
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , is this : what &apos;s going on with the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my bag , on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check from $ <unk> to fund my <unk> next year .
my name is <unk> .
in 18 months ago , i made something else at google , and i &apos;m <unk> to do something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is also , i gave me a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education in britain -- i &apos;m not -- but i had a lot of museums , and i had no access to the museums .
when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried this desire to make art more accessible -- with technology .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;m going to start with you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
you just go to <unk> .
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the van gogh , van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come to two because it &apos;s very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and passionate about it .
you want to get to the museum ?
you open the map , and jump it with a click .
they &apos;re in , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just further . a lot of fun .
forage .
thank you , but the best one is .
so now i &apos;m one of my <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum has given us the image , click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i click now .
this is one of the images that we held with the so-called <unk> .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can be very easily in and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing , and i realized there &apos;s something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to get close , and slowly , slowly , these kids actually beat something .
i was a little bit , i spoke with some known at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called <unk> , where a goose is hit on the <unk> with a stick .
it seems quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to get really close to it , you can go to cracks .
just to give you a sense of <unk> , i &apos;m going to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is going on -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you don &apos;t want to see how van gogh creating this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re <unk> in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my <unk> this image until i &apos;m really about cracks .
this is <unk> , probably never saw that before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
and that &apos;s the really cool part , it means collections .
each of you , everybody -- you know if rich or arm , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go back and online their own museum -- from all these images , you can put your own collection .
very simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it means the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put it all up with comments , send your friends , and start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , the main thing for me is the main thing that all the wonderful things are coming here from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to just do with this digital medium of art , and they represent work online .
this is the greatest question i asked to do , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s what it is . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can <unk> in two halves .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right-hand half , the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of each hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this is somebody that &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on that scale ?
some of us may have decided to have one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high <unk> that is in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if it &apos;s both exclusive or so forth .
they can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , in common with most of the others who need a good percentage of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good number of intuition to do the experiments actually .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing it with things .
so we go out and play with it and see how it responds , and then we start developing our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be just a place at the same time .
i mean , it can be strange to think that a thing at the same time is in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember seeing a child playing on the playing of a <unk> .
he was still a toddler , not very good at it , and he was constantly falling .
but i bet he taught him to play a very valuable lesson , which is that big things taught you by simply , and they &apos;re going to stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as it is not a <unk> .
it would be a horrible model for a <unk> , because they &apos;re not playing with <unk> , but with these little odd particles .
and when you play with their particles , you find all kinds of weird things -- as they fly directly through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed to describe the small , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need them to describe it to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that didn &apos;t like my intuition , and perhaps just because i &apos;m not so often playing with particles .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it .
because if all these things are made out of particles and all these particles are following the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just to the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why this should not be like that .
so i &apos;d be able to feel the <unk> of the whole thing , if we could kind of show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle there .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s an image of the object .
here i &apos;m going to expand something . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and here &apos;s a really very big close-up of this little metal .
so what we look at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s like a springboard and it stands over the edge .
so i made this thing in a way that makes a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- in order to get this kind of a <unk> pool and getting this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m on the elevator alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i get other odd people , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t really want them to bother , or , frankly , it <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects feel as well .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not only people , but the light that seems to it , and the wind that seems to them by <unk> and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is <unk> , we had to get rid of all the <unk> out .
and we did that .
we turned the light off , we put it into a vacuum , and they put it out into a vacuum , and it <unk> all the way down to the elevator , the piece of metal was free to behave as it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it really moves .
instead of it , it &apos;s just quiet there , it &apos;s just <unk> . the way it was like it was like this -- like this <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push in the same time , we could actually vibrate at the same time and not vibrate -- something that &apos;s only allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms of the atoms are still silent , and at the same time , the same atoms move on and down .
it &apos;s just too precise to <unk> .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that each atom at the same time is in two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , check that , the <unk> between a single atom and that piece of metal is about just the same metal between the difference and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places , that piece of metal can be two different places , why not you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you would be in a couple of places at a couple of places , how would that feel ?
how would your mind manage to deal with your body in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal always was there in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it looks like all the objects in the elevator , really just <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not really right .
there &apos;s even more , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s like these connections , their compounds with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families want to think about where they want to live and work , the opportunity to choose between at least a hand full of different cities that are all in competition .
right now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world that doesn &apos;t even have a single city to be available that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs them .
so we could be able to do the world very easily with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
and they &apos;re just going to trade it from homes against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in apartments do this ; the other half is not yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you would like to do in these apartments and their environment , their environment , to be able to avoid grievances and move from <unk> .
so it turns out to be very hard out of all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place to build a completely new place block , assuming the laws there would be able to support this and not <unk> it .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments can create new surfaces that have enough space for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
i found out later that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> , about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> left their country to <unk> in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in honduras .
at this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we <unk> a <unk> area of our country , what if we just put them in a message to the american embassy , a part of the canadian <unk> , and when people are going to go to work under the canadian rules , or the united states , you can work there , and can you go to canada .
in the summer of 2009 , honduras , under a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in a turnaround , whose software would be promised as well .
he challenged <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared a talk to tedglobal at tedglobal .
so through improvement , trial and studying consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city to essentially reduce elements .
the first point , is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t have to disturb existing <unk> .
we add new technologies big attention , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and they &apos;re usually the laws that help us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and again , the <unk> showed him .
those two were called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of the <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are about how much more valuable they are .
and i used this chart to show you how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , think that a area is worth thousands of dollars per square meter of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract debate , at a place when there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form , in very simple form , is that a <unk> city is a place that &apos;s beginning to be the beginning of <unk> land , a <unk> that determines the laws that have to rule out there , either under those rules of life or not .
and that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we need to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that it &apos;s the way to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and i was going to hold a talk on the fourth and fifth january .
so i &apos;ve given another thing that i &apos;m talking about with the fact that has a graph like this one , which has tried to make sure that if you want a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in <unk> .
in this airport alone , a area of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 tomorrow .
polite <unk> all the time .
the faces of the audience were very serious and alert .
the head of congress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the statement that a new city offers new possibilities .
there would be the ability to live in a city that would be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
and the leaders of government , in honduras , would be on aid from <unk> , and they could benefit from their <unk> , which they would set up in the set of the laws of the law and can support that the charter will actually get off .
and the realization of president <unk> was that the confidence of the <unk> that i &apos;ve thought of as a way to get the foreign investors to get here and to build this city for all parties in honduras , who have been under fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it <unk> a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , you have voted in congress for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> policy that &apos;s in particular <unk> .
in a country that has just been a violent crisis in congress , congress was elected to a voice for <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
but to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress twice .
on february 17th , it &apos;s been approved to a voice with <unk> .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st and 24 of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> has been a delegation of about 30 <unk> to the two places in the world , who were most interested in the business of the <unk> .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new downtown center that built <unk> <unk> in south korea , in south korea .
all you can see on this picture , within four years , after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was really interested in urbanism is singapore .
it has already built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a <unk> , and you &apos;re already considering this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that <unk> allows to participate , and it will also work on a external legal system .
one country has already offered his supreme court , as a court for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
it also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even get funding with it .
one thing as you already know , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are lots of businesses that would like to put in america especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all over the world , there are 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to live in a different place .
one million people every year every year migrate to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families , and sometimes they &apos;re <unk> , sometimes there are single mothers who have to earn enough money to eat themselves and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes there are kids who are trying to find their parents &apos; parents , which they haven &apos;t seen in some cases for a decade .
so what is it for an idea to build a completely new city to build a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or building hundreds around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
i asked my friends from honduras to me , thank you , thank you .
do you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently done a poll with 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices , which is a typical person in a day is <unk> .
and also , recently , a study was made with ceos where they were watching the ceos for a week .
and these scientists just have documented the different issues that the ceo has done , and how much time they were doing making decisions that relate to these issues .
and they found that an average ceo has been engaged in the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these topics was , of course , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been hit within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you do in the nine minutes category of those are an hour ?
how good do you think it &apos;s going to make the decisions about ?
today , i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> store , at least at least it was really exclusive .
it was a store , the <unk> &apos;s called .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and <unk> , and more than two dozen different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we &apos;ve actually had <unk> .
i loved going to this business , but i &apos;ve asked myself , well , how does it be that you &apos;ve never been doing something ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were locked into boxes that came from a thousand years of <unk> .
so i decided to get the leader one day , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model work , that you really provide all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the <unk> of tourists who came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
and we set up a little <unk> directly at the nest entrance .
we &apos;ve put six different tastes or 24 different tastes , and we put two things on : first , i guess what case would be more people and try and try and try ?
there are more people have remained , if it was 24 , about 60 percent than when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were more likely to buy a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
by the people who stayed when it was 24 , bought only three percent of actually a glass of <unk> .
from the people who stayed when it was six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of a glass <unk> .
now , if you do it , i would buy people six times a glass of <unk> when they had six to the selection , when they had 24 / 7 .
now , to decide not to buy glass in glass , probably it &apos;s good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> is also influenced us with very <unk> choices .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even when it comes to our own best interests .
so the theme of the day , financial saving .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i was doing with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were doing the decisions to spend almost a million americans in about <unk> plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was if the number of <unk> that were possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be saved by a <unk> plan , the probability of whether more tomorrow .
and what we found is that there was a context in fact .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans that gave people anything between two to 59 different plans .
and what we found was that the more fund was the more fund that , in fact , that was participation that was participation .
if you look at the extremes , the plans that offered two fund , a <unk> in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans of nearly 60 fund , the <unk> dropped now on about the <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re in a <unk> , when there were more options on choice , then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more than that the more opportunities they were available , the more avoiding it , the more avoiding it and fund .
the more opportunities they were available , the more they were more likely to put their own money in just <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone recommend , if you &apos;re the future financial well-being , is important .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that make it for more and more choices .
they set out the decision -- push them , even when it comes to your own best interest .
they tend to make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide more to things that you &apos;re going to be less happy , even if you make objective better .
and the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge shelves of <unk> , mustard and <unk> and <unk> , but we actually can &apos;t move to the comparison and we can actually make some of the amazing charge .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways , and on various ways that they can just apply in their business .
first of all : narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today , that less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they always worry that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
but in fact , let &apos;s see it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be able to narrow , and the <unk> will be going on , well , there &apos;s a increase in sales , and then there &apos;s a cost of sales , and there &apos;s an increase in <unk> .
as <unk> and gamble , the different head and gamble of <unk> and <unk> species of 26 down , it would be sales for 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation , her 10 is <unk> <unk> , experienced that the gains by 87 percent -- a result of the two , the increase of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> is now giving you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart provides 100,000 products today .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is now <unk> <unk> in the world today , and they &apos;re just giving you 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples that recently come on the market is how to <unk> the choice , something that david <unk> has very strong <unk> , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff takes now to a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice , are offered to 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to narrow it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing that i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to <unk> them , they can &apos;t do it . &quot;
well , before we had lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to offer all the people in this audience to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read them to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and i want to ask you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s offer .
all that ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that you looked at objective , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would dare to guess it was the second time you felt it in the second time .
because the pictures made it real for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding people to understand the difference between ways , to understand what consequences are associated with the individual opportunities and that have to feel vivid and specific .
why are people going to do about 15 to 30 percent more if they use a <unk> card or a card card ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you get it to feel specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so , in a study that i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- employees who have all been working for <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed their participation in a gathering .
and during this meeting , we ended up the meeting as it was always , we just added a little thing .
the little thing we &apos;ve got to do is that we asked people to just think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
where we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation around 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save , or a rise to four percent of the amount they were willing to pay for the <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can do better with more categories than more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> factory .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> , and down in the northeast area , the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines has up to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you show them into 10 categories or i show you 400 magazines , and they have these in 20 categories , you believe that i gave you more choices and a better <unk> than i gave them 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the others &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> , and the ad on the right jazz is , you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that &apos;s on the left jazz side , and that , on the right side , is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
they have to say the categories is something called the choice .
and this problem , you often see if you look at the long list of all of these fund .
who do you really want to inform them ?
my fourth technique : premise for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually handle more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who gives you the opportunity to <unk> her car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to create their car completely .
now these decisions are different from the number of choices that they provide a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
now what i do now is i change the order of decisions .
half of the clients will go from the many possibilities , 56 percent of the possibilities , four gears .
the other half of customers are going from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how are they interested .
if you &apos;re constantly using the <unk> of choice , that means that they &apos;re going to be overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what you &apos;re finding is that the people who are always going to go to the low <unk> , and they &apos;re going to choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
let &apos;s go from the little choice to the many , then you stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order of changing the order of this information .
when i start to start with the simple , i learn how i <unk> .
even though the gear you choose to do nothing about my preferences at the interior , it &apos;s still trying to pick me on this .
it &apos;s also <unk> me about the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m ready to motivate myself to be with interest .
so let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that &apos;s the problem of <unk> <unk> -- narrow -- you &apos;re going to get the <unk> alternatives . <unk> -- make it real ; we can do better with more categories , less categories .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the opportunity -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for the people who have service for service .
because i think the key to the best choices is that you &apos;re a choice .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> with youtube , i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed as infinitely difficult .
but <unk> has allowed us all of us or all our creative activities are in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous by the internet until next saturday .
but when youtube is uploaded to more than 48 hours a minute .
and again , just a tiny percentage of a second ever <unk> , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times , and so on the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year <unk> <unk> <unk> this video he was filmed in front of his house in <unk> national park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer for the first time .
actually , no viral video didn &apos;t want to do .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do that , if you &apos;re called <unk> mountain <unk> .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> .
and this video actually had already been on january of january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> : tweet the tweet at the end of the day .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> are asking us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , you get <unk> on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> on <unk> . she didn &apos;t think we would have that conversation without talking about this video .
rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was nearly 200 million times this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> , &quot; it seems like nothing to come .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , that particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , a lot of blogs started to write about it .
michael j. nelson : the <unk> science theater was a first person to make a joke about this .
the important thing is that an individual or a group of <unk> had a position to put a point of view with a large audience and shared the process .
and then this community was formed by people who shared this big <unk> , and we started to talk about it with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of youtube from youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day of day .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way of being part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it was nearly 50 million times .
and if you think it &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> , that four million times a million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
what &apos;s important is the creativity that we have in the <unk> and <unk> .
there were remixes back .
somebody did an ancient version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot out of the ground , which made it a kind of joke to something that we all can participate in .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something we do .
who would have anticipate all this ?
who would have predicted &quot; double <unk> , &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; can predict ? &quot;
what <unk> can be able to write in that kind of <unk> ?
in a world , in which every minute two days of video is uploaded to video can only be really unique and unexpected <unk> like that .
i &apos;m not very interested in that , i was not terribly interested when a friend told me to look at this great video about a guy who was protesting a traffic ticket in new york .
i got a ticket , because i didn &apos;t have a ticket on the <unk> , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t leave you properly on the <unk> .
because it was completely surprising and humorous , casey <unk> became funny idea and his argument five million times .
so this approach is true for everything we &apos;re creative .
and all that leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , that has any access to the audience and determines the audience .
as i said , one of the great stars -- justin bieber -- made his start with youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green light .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as well as owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re also barely hitting the media today , but they &apos;re going to determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i sitting in 10 minutes talking about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness was <unk> in a four-year-old girl , when she was sitting over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and night <unk> in a small boat in the chinese sea , and i was sitting in a little girl in the eastern sea and never disappeared -- this little girl .
the story isn &apos;t over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man that burns his life &apos;s work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by unity and freedom of his home .
if you think of it in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , how he must admit that his life has been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother will never let me forget .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to <unk> us , but it passed through .
the next <unk> shows like a boat in the early <unk> of lake <unk> .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for her , life had asked her a job : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that she could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the lake as <unk> selling .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
they had the greatest fear of pirates , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother had a little bit of <unk> .
if you had a <unk> , i just would have my sister and i and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- and there &apos;s the continuous <unk> of the engine , the clapping of every wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came to the pirates many times , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat deceive on our boat , or the <unk> of the engine , who didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights of <unk> off the coast of the coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first <unk> that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted like that again .
after three months in the refugee camp , we landed in melbourne in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations who are building together a new life .
we put ourselves into <unk> , which is one of the early <unk> suburb , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smell of <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> were in between people who had one thing in common . they started new .
my mother worked on farms , and then on an assembly line in a <unk> , six days , <unk> layers .
it somehow managed to find the time , english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and was put in education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do , and mostly the new things that came out of all the time .
two pieces of <unk> for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to <unk> , because it had to reach six years .
and there was the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot;
my mom and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other from our day and listened to our grandmother &apos;s movements .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their <unk> came , so i could <unk> her .
and she opened up a <unk> , and then they opened up a business .
and the women came up with their stories about men who don &apos;t change the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the <unk> demands of himself .
in the other , i was involved in uncertain life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the isolation .
but so many got help over the years .
and because of this help , i was <unk> in my last year of <unk> as a young <unk> of the year .
and i &apos;ve been <unk> from a <unk> to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , blind <unk> of <unk> , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak of places that she had never heard of , and in homes , whose existence would never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to a routine , and the comfort of life &apos;s life , a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who told each of their days as <unk> as for 20 years by telling each other the stories of their day , telling each other the stories of their day and <unk> .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was as old as they were at the time when we climbed the boat .
no has never been an opportunity .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and unless you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and training , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i could not come up with a career in law school .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , <unk> in the picture -- not just all right , but something that you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of <unk> .
because <unk> can be so easy to collapse in collapse of the horizons so easy to mean that you accepted the assumptions of the environment .
now , i &apos;ve gone out to know from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not like it &apos;s <unk> .
the possibility that didn &apos;t have been allowed , explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and <unk> .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not &quot; a <unk> challenge .
for one year , we had no cents .
at the end of one tags , i cook a giant pot of soup we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant ones , and we were able to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to draw in the united states .
after just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later i moved , and the adventure continued to go .
before i <unk> the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the age of the social norm and the local mandarin the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
when she was 17 , she was the second woman to hit her mom .
and without support of her husband , she was worried about a <unk> by <unk> him , and she was <unk> in her own case , and even greater <unk> when she won .
&quot; was not <unk> as <unk> .
i just <unk> in a <unk> hotel in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at the other side .
i knew she had come to leave himself .
so my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and <unk> her that we were still with them .
at midnight , the monk came and said he had to close to the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your hand is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve got it tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t catch her . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men that might come in our lives , who would be in the <unk> .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think about the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave , the <unk> , continuous <unk> of the engine , the vast horizon that nothing guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it and make it safely , i would do it .
and also , mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or five series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because , of course , that &apos;s a picture you can &apos;t take with your camera .
nevertheless , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera at age 15 .
i combined with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because when the camera was using the camera in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process , the process , when you press the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed more like to go to the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins the process when catalyst will keep going .
photos like this : a construction site goes along a much <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and there &apos;s still a realistic level .
or photographs like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the shared goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to make it look like this as if you could have that , in a picture .
photos , where you have to think about a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more like to capture an idea as a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details , or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what does the illusion of illusion ?
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i look at it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together in order to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect objects that we all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , combined , you can do something that looks still more three-dimensional than whether it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really just make sense of it .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about putting different realities .
so the things that make a realistic picture , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not three special images .
but combined , you can combine something special about this .
so the first rule is that some combined pictures should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined with some of the other pictures that we should have .
and these two images meet these two requirements of those two requirements and shot out of the same altitude .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images are starting and end by connecting them into it .
does it impossible to say that the photograph was actually put together .
so by putting color , contrast and light on the edge of the individual images , photographic types of other <unk> , like <unk> colors and disorders , we <unk> the boundaries between the different images , and let them look like a single photograph , though a single picture is basically hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom line was manipulated .
now , this picture is completely composed of reality , from photos of different places .
and i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place than find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise into the ideas with the ideas .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the bank comes from a different place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red , to make it look for swiss .
so to do a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s looking out of me out of planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very well planned .
and when you make good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited in is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced to the <unk> was to take a <unk> .
this is not particularly scientifically scientific -- you ask a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how do it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems that everybody -- maybe only most of the electronic <unk> fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i get on it .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve got my job at 95 pounds coming up .
it just works , every time i get on the scale , send my data on google health .
and they &apos;re going to <unk> them from my <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> lies , and it &apos;s not just at the moment where i need <unk> , or so , in a view of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
you might know that , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning , i get to my <unk> and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch a little salad today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used for obesity .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and get them to play together in common with some kind of play to control their health better .
next week , that comes to the market .
there will be this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to give you to an iphone or something like that .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure your blood pressure from home to send him to their doctor and share it with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come in . you can &apos;t just take control of control , captain on their own ship , but we can also help in health care with the challenges that we are in , and the health care of healthcare , double demand , and so on .
make the methods that are easy to use and start embracing them with this one to hug patients .
and they can do that through such ways , but also through <unk> .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all atm machines are around .
we know another one where all stations are .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
but where about the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving <unk> was in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we set up a website , and we asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during <unk> , of course , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> has been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we &apos;ve designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality , to find that <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and somebody goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you also have to find your <unk> to find the next <unk> of life .
and now we don &apos;t just want to do this today as <unk> as the product is called the product , but also to do it as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , about helping us to behave like <unk> , to crowdsource , to crowdsource this <unk> throughout the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and someone &apos;s going to collapse , it &apos;s your own blood or someone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us all over the world for <unk> these <unk> .
they could be <unk> , or a technician , for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its place .
please help us and try to improve health , not just to do something , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report in unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants us to force ourselves to the environment by ...
... it &apos;s a <unk> of crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh , a moment .
it may be sent to it .
now -- we can just skip that off -- i &apos;m going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the star into technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that is pretty much anything , which they really hate , we &apos;re going to work them in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like <unk> for geeks .
we choose a bunch of fellows , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what they really do is to show what technology is possible today .
so you meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
and here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who <unk> him when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> .
how did he look for the special kind of aid ?
so last year , we had a team of fellows in boston with the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> in february .
and they realized that the city never <unk> the city .
but a certain fellow , a man named erik <unk> , did notice something else , and that was that residents were free to <unk> the sidewalks in front of these parts .
so he did what every good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> him free to <unk> when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he &apos;s called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that &apos;s written the fellows last year .
but she does something no other <unk> .
it &apos;s going fast .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city in the city , who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizen <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle , seattle , decided to use the app to <unk> the citizens of the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago is just introduced , so that people <unk> the <unk> when it <unk> .
we &apos;re now familiar with nine cities to use this app .
and she has spreads , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know it doesn &apos;t usually go .
so the <unk> of software takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston , for three people , a half months .
it went to a way to find out the parents that are the right public schools for their children .
we later told us that if it would go over the normal channels that would take it over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california justice that the taxpayer cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at any level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it turns out by <unk> , it &apos;s a kind of shot in front of a bug in the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that it represents a new generation that <unk> the problem of the government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now , there &apos;s a big community of people that make the tools that we need to make things effective together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people in all over the country who write and write <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they wouldn &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget your feelings about politics and the queue of the <unk> and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we do not to do . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you &apos;re going to get out of it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their power out of us -- <unk> you , &quot; we are the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , what &apos;s going to happen to happen .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought that the government is mostly about choosing people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s all about the community to go around .
this is the call center for service and information .
they usually come out of when you &apos;re <unk> in your city .
if you ever have a chance to work in your <unk> call center , as our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , do all of you -- you &apos;ll see that the people who are calling the government for many different problems , including that a <unk> in your house .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he type <unk> into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . it starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and play very loud music , and see if the cattle <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
there &apos;s not just a call center .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is a very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happened with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott talked about human beings .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public so that everyone can see it .
and in this case , it &apos;s a neighbor .
and the next point we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
<unk> on the page . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is what digital is true .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government gets into <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped a different citizen , but the government played a central role .
she connected these two people .
and you would have been able to connect them with government performance if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor of the other helps , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s an input from the other .
that our contribution to the system is the system .
how often are we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we lean back and we expect the government to reflect our values , and then it hasn &apos;t changed much ?
that &apos;s because the government is a more ocean , and politics are the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below it is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word in this contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , and we &apos;re paying for , to be something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution , this institution for us , we need to make bureaucracy , sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual thing is happening .
we need to be in the machinery of government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is an answer to the <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> .
this is not politically active , which is <unk> .
well , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we &apos;re thinking about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to ask .
do we really think we need to do what we need to do without improving the institution that can be in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it &apos;s got to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to create the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by actually raising society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has been grown up with <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to just build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with this to see their voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight , which we all fight to speak , is to talk to you .
you can make your opinion on every channel at every channel , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care so much to use your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be to be a fire hydrant , weeds to <unk> , turn a trash garbage <unk> .
and sure , if we could have this fire hydrant all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of the government to receive taxes and services .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government , until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all been here for all of you is , if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we need to do together , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in helping people explain how wonderful the new technologies that are going to be at the rise , and i thought i was here in my friends , i would tell you what i really quickly do , and also trying to look back and understand what was so quick .
i &apos;m going to begin to show you a little bit of a little bit of boring slide .
... if you could just show the slide .
this is a slide i picked up from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of this slide , but rather , it &apos;s about the general form .
so this slide shows data from an analysis to the performance of <unk> processors compared to the power of an area of networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like as some of the other , which we find in our field , is a kind of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here corresponds to a potency of <unk> .
and this is a novelty , that we have to use this guy on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could turn the light back again .
a little bit brighter because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , you know , this is the years here , so the timeline of a way , and this is a random measure of technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph becomes silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a <unk> , then that would be on the <unk> scale , in a form of a flat line .
but if something like this is happening here , it changes the <unk> conditions .
so , if the <unk> would be as fast as the current progression , then we could go into a taxi in a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , through which , the scale , every few years .
so the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you see , you don &apos;t go to it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever evolved forever as fast as it is now .
there are two possibilities .
you &apos;re either going to get a classic <unk> like here , like something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s about something .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is going to happen in the way that this is going on .
it &apos;s really like that , then that means we &apos;re in the middle right now right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i also have a place , is what this new world will be ?
what &apos;s this new condition that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you find that the future still lies in the year 2000 .
more than we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future of every year , the future has declined since i &apos;ve been in this world .
i think the reason for this is that we realize there is something happening .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that it &apos;s simply not a sense of trying to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different , that a simple <unk> of what we don &apos;t do now .
now i want to talk about what that could be , this is this transition in which we are right now .
to do this first , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have anything with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life in the earth .
i think the picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and this is a 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of <unk> chemicals .
now , if you were looking at the way these chemicals are organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they &apos;re doing it .
i think there are theories that are starting to understand how everything has started rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little simplified story of that , which is that at this time , little <unk> <unk> , which had different kinds of chemicals in chemicals .
some of these <unk> had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other other chemicals from the outside and therefore grow .
all those were , began to tile .
these little <unk> were in terms of <unk> <unk> .
but it wasn &apos;t something that was alive in today &apos;s sense , because each one of them was just a small , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they &apos;ve spread chemicals into disparate amounts .
so each <unk> was slightly different .
in fact , the <unk> grew , which had an economic chemistry , faster than others and integrated and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so these tend to survive longer , and it multiplied into <unk> extent .
so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it &apos;s going to be , when this <unk> learned a trick over abstraction .
there &apos;s a way that we don &apos;t really understand , this is the ability to <unk> the ability to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and that &apos;s in a certain chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they have found a way in this <unk> , evolutionary way that allowed them to be <unk> of , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information over the time of 2.5 billion years where they were born , the same thing .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and each creature is using exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are as far as we can , only for the most powerful , in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from <unk> .
it &apos;s in it -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to <unk> -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written it 10 ^ 22 .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a <unk> , i would have written it in a virus , and i &apos;ve written it into space .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another one happened , very interesting , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s where these cells began to communicate and exchange information so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually share their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , it grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how you can stay from penicillin , and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
that communications now allowed communities , which were in some sense in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they were either survived , or they went together , and that meant that if a community succeeded , all the individuals of the community were more often repeated over and by evolution .
now , the <unk> is where these communities are so close to this community that they determined to write the recipe for the entire community in a <unk> .
and then the next billion years took about another billion years .
at this point we have <unk> communities , communities of lots of <unk> <unk> , which are functioning together as an individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that aren &apos;t asked anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the plane , in which evolution happened , no longer the single cell , but the whole <unk> , which we call organism .
the next step was happening within these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t make anything different from information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that they &apos;ve built together .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning to understand and to capture that information .
and this was the brain nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point an individual -- learning happened in the period of a individual organism , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so one organism could be learning to eat a certain fruit , because she made it bad and made him sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could happen in the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before hundreds of thousands of years , that that information had to be learned from the individuals , which died because of these fruit cells , because these <unk> are not there .
so the nervous system is that the nervous system , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen within time .
what happened afterwards is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
for example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a rather amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , <unk> , <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically giving some <unk> sounds of me , hoping to create a similar <unk> idea in your head , which has a resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and producing something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this is actually allowing us to be a unified organism again .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we , humanity , is we started abstract .
we go through the same steps , which has gone through <unk> -- the abstraction of our techniques , how we &apos;re presenting data .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on , all of our specialized mechanisms we built in our community , to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s able to continue to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the period of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> little <unk> where he showed up a little bit of evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again <unk> .
the first steps of the story , which i told you , is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem just a few decades to take .
the process is feeding itself and becomes , and so i think <unk> is the word for this -- if something is more <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live in a living for a living for a living in computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , without the recently done , <unk> advances in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional meaning .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what &apos;s also doing designers thinking <unk> is , we &apos;re thinking of a conscience , <unk> this machine , and the machine does something that is far beyond our skills , better and faster than we could ever do it .
and it makes it part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using recently is evolution itself .
in this process , we install a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in <unk> .
so to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> a hundred million randomly chosen <unk> sequences .
now , please take all these randomly chosen instructions , show all the programs , and then finally pick the people who are the next to them . &quot;
so in other words , i guess what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to sort of like numbers , which would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using .
so find programs that can kind of kind of sort of sort of sort of sort of place .
of course , the chance in random elected instructions is very small , they &apos;re sort of <unk> numbers , so probably none of the instructions will actually do this .
but one of them may be lucky two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the only 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve come to the next .
store these down , <unk> the rest .
now <unk> all the <unk> that have the numbers at best .
it &apos;s a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they &apos;re producing children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the characteristics of the <unk> of the two programs .
so , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that emerged through combinations of programs that have come closer to us than others .
say , &quot; please do this process . &quot;
get back again .
take a couple of mutations .
and try this with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or in more complex cases , a few hours .
and then finally , i get programs to make numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i &apos;ve ever had .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s abstruse and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their life depended on the job right .
i once sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , he <unk> a card and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
it says , &quot; this plane is made out of <unk> <unk> , which are working together in order to make your flight safer . &apos; does it not ? &quot;
we know it &apos;s not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process that &apos;s very different from classical engineering .
he allows us to make things a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibility of it .
so , <unk> <unk> is the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we &apos;re able to make these processes even faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it becomes faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are now feeding themselves .
we lift up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is at the time , the analog is at the time , as <unk> is evolved .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really make what the hell we &apos;re really creating .
we &apos;re in the middle of that <unk> .
but i really think there &apos;s something like this .
i find it very <unk> to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever is next .
now lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear now , before i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about nothing for the time of the ancient indian <unk> &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in the time , we went into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we are doing airplanes .
back then , when the great indian <unk> <unk> thirst took a bow , shot into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera , without tweet on my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
it became a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and images in my imagination .
it was like , when we were thinking , our fancy clocks and cameras came to dreams .
they kept us being inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it magic to allow them to make magic .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to connect the readers around the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it bring images and text together and animation , sounds and touch .
in storytelling , it took more sense .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box belongs , &quot; i write my name .
and it becomes a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- which is right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about this opportunity .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass , i found always quite exciting .
so you have to blow the ipad out here , and the fireflies are <unk> .
and that <unk> the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and therefore , every book , and every world is going to be a little bit of <unk> , which i &apos;m putting here on the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always maps cards , but these maps were static .
this map is growing , and it &apos;s shining , and it &apos;s an orientation for guidance in the rest of the book .
it also shows the other one in the book .
i go in here .
it also matters for me to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard about <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were trapped thousands of years in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history of children .
it &apos;s a story with new issues , like the <unk> .
on the subject of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without go out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
so in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads images of natural objects .
as a child , i was collections of <unk> collections , rocks and <unk> .
some of the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is going to be <unk> . you have to go out to make a picture of one flower and tag a picture .
in one other chapter , you have to take a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a kid in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , today i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology .
so in the next book , we plan to do an interaction where you &apos;re using the ipads , and through augmented reality , an animation of <unk> is seen from a plant in front of the house .
in one place , the screen is <unk> with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , blow the rest of the book .
we all move to a world in which the nature of technology comes closer and in the magic and technology and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we get closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest of the <unk> and in places where there are plenty of hopelessness .
to be here at ted , to see how stimulating this is , i gave a lot of power .
so , in the short time , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can tell things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher has meaning , but i think that the words of a driven teacher is particularly meaningful .
so as a doctor , you can do good . but as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn the way in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who was dominated by a <unk> , and that <unk> was dominated by my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in any <unk> .
she was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in <unk> in virginia as slaves .
she was born by 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped a lot .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and she got me <unk> .
she hit me so that i could barely breathe , and then she made me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; no , &quot; she said me again . if i said , &quot; yes , let me get me alone .
she was something that was made , that you wanted to be close to it .
the only problem that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember eight or nine that i woke up one in the morning and went into the living room , all my cousins were running around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up , and she came to me over , and she took me on my hand and said , &quot; come on . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember that it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out with me , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , the first thing you &apos;re going to do is you &apos;ll always love your mama . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you to take care of you . &quot;
and i &apos;m holding my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next <unk> i said , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise is &quot; you &apos;ve never ever got alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer beer with me and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we <unk> just like anything else .
then he took a drink of beer , and he offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took them on , and then offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . you &apos;re ok . do you just . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this , you do that , but you do anything we do .
i had what your sister had . go off , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . does it just . does it just . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy ?
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother told all grandchildren that you &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is perhaps going to transmit publicly .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m <unk> that i &apos;ve never had to drink any of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that , because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say it &apos;s identity that means identity .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us , they can &apos;t tell us things .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all your grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in prison during the <unk> .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the subjects that we need to care about .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are released on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , <unk> has changed our world .
in social and black parts of the population of the population of common despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black , black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison at <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere , in the country -- from los angeles of philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- is 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men in prison , in prison in prison at <unk> or <unk> .
but our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also going to be through poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country , which is a lot better treated when they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , affects the outcome .
yet we seem to be very happy with it .
the politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost contact .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> developments .
my home state in alabama is <unk> them permanently , if you &apos;ve neanderthals <unk> .
and today , in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently lost their hands .
we <unk> that , in 10 years , the ratio of the civic sector will be as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that <unk> children <unk> children in prison .
in this one of our country , there are <unk> <unk> for children in this country .
we &apos;ve already got a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe that because we &apos;ve taught it so that the real question is : has a human being made for a person to die for him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think of it as well as we see our identity .
the other view is not : somebody deserves a crime for a crime , but : did we deserve it ?
i find that fascinating .
death penalty is defined by error .
on nine people we were executed , we &apos;ve got one that we found for innocent judged , the <unk> and from death death .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , it &apos;s going to launch .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not the burden of burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking to my students african history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the world , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that was shaped her life .
these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you talk , they keep talks . they say they should stop saying that , for the first time , we &apos;ve got to do it for the first time in our nation .
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated surrender and apartheid .
and yet there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions are in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting each other .
we always create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not to get over without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were those willingness to rwanda , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany to the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists , after my talk , said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly disturbing to hear you like this . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s not a death sentence .
and of course , you can never give in germany . &quot;
it was completely silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible to tell us that we &apos;re ever going to get back to the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> of us and aware of people . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world in which the german state of people had <unk> people , especially when there were a lot of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re facing people -- here &apos;s the risk to death row , 11 times higher when the victim is white , when it &apos;s black , 22 times higher when the <unk> is the body in their bodies .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental <unk> system .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these tough topics , the positive and amazing things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities of <unk> , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
it &apos;s important to me to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to pass in a complex world .
for me , the time for me is creating time to think and talk about the poor , the <unk> , which will never be at ted .
but think of a way that is integrated in our own life .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re rational , we appreciate the intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s these <unk> , which i believe is that it drives us , not just open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do all sorts of things , but what we needed most was hope , a <unk> guidance , the willingness to be in <unk> places and to be witness . &quot;
and this <unk> orientation is the core of what i think is also going to have to get involved in this .
there &apos;s no line about technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t see eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
she will deeply touch them .
when i was a young lawyer , i was privileged to meet the great privilege .
and again , woman parks came back again to <unk> , where she had two of their oldest friends <unk> these older women , <unk> <unk> , who had organized the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and in virginia , a white , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king .
so these women met and talked to themselves .
and then , a woman called me down , and then she said , &quot; <unk> , wife comes into the city . we want a conversation .
do you want <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very .
she said , &quot; what will you do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
and i went over , and i just stopped .
it was so inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , women turned to me , said , &quot; well <unk> , tell me what the initiative is right in the same .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who became innocent .
we want to fight <unk> and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without making mistakes for children .
we want something against the death penalty company .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make them very , very tired . &quot;
and then she said a finger to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think that the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to ask ways to make these challenges : these issues , that &apos;s suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned some very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to him , it &apos;s not just a plant .
even who kills someone , it &apos;s not just a murderer .
and because this is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so exhilarating , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not in the things that we develop , not in our intellect and minds .
and finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the convicted , the <unk> .
because in that context , we start to understand the really amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing that balance . a story for the end .
sometimes i push too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of all of us .
sometimes these ideas of our thinking ahead , in a very important way .
i <unk> these kids who have been convicted of very <unk> punishment .
i go to the <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , to be an adult .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judges turn into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
and one night i stayed too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something different , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should be the wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think more right , i started working on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor black boy as a client client .
and i started with this . the headline said , &quot; to my poor , <unk> black client as an privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
i explained in my bill that <unk> <unk> and the police are <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> in this country , that there &apos;s only been <unk> .
and the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i dreamed of these crazy , or indeed , had written .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t just write him , but sent to court .
for a few months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to tell you in the court , and i &apos;m saying this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to the dish .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do so painful .
i finally got out of my car , and i went to the stairs .
when i was <unk> the staircase for the dish , there was an older man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came up to me over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and i was <unk> .
and he &apos;s in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
and i have to say , there was me power .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute to each other , to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i walked into the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you put these crazy . &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
and more people would come in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry , that we talked about color languages about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors on and down .
he looked again through the window , and he could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on and down .
finally , this older black man came up with a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat down behind me , almost to the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
during the pause , a <unk> came in that the janitors was in the <unk> .
and this <unk> ran over to the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say this young man , you don &apos;t give the goal out of your eyes .
i came to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum in the universe is far <unk> , but that it <unk> justice .
that we are not fully designed as humans , unless we care about human rights and <unk> .
that our entire survival is survival with survival .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and creation of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to tell you that as well , just say , don &apos;t you lose the goal . don &apos;t give the goal .
you have seen an obvious wish in this audience to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a spring <unk> in this spring , which is actually a effort to do , something from the <unk> <unk> that flows into politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to have a billion dollars a billion dollars for death penalty for the death penalty .
and yet , 46 percent of all doesn &apos;t end up with a <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> did not come to court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this is going to suggest that you &apos;re going to suggest that money to invest in more and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the united states of america &apos;s immense down in america .
and that &apos;s the fact that often has been put in a relationship with the heightened <unk> .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of knowledge has not changed very much .
the majority of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really think in the class of <unk> .
it was <unk> <unk> against drugs .
that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers come in prison .
we have <unk> from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> <unk> , to bring people out forever behind bars , for a <unk> , <unk> , rather than that you force them to give back the sacrifice of the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who are victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current don &apos;t help our current <unk> .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they really did have a string string .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you .
bin laden &apos;s death is going to be an increased <unk> .
two : famine in somalia . you have three : spray of the police .
four : malignant <unk> . four : dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . we have seven : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> . 9 : <unk>
different speakers : <unk> . wmd .
recession . <unk> . egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . disaster . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it would have been the last six days -- or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds are giving attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second , every second , our senses will catch much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our <unk> .
and <unk> all the information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so , when we see the news , we prefer to think of the negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it <unk> , the demand is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices that seven days of all of us , 24 hours a day of all this negative news , it &apos;s no wonder that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces are so strong that it &apos;s possible for us in the next three decades to create a world of excess .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , water , water and <unk> -- we have already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at <unk> problems in a very long way , but ultimately they &apos;re finally <unk> .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the past century so that we can predict development .
over the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has <unk> to inflation , which has tripled .
child mortality has reduced a tenth .
and that &apos;s what it comes out is that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and cost to a pair of times .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> has gone up by 25 percent over the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we continue to increase our expectations .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
remember , a lot of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , <unk> , <unk> and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth would never have been able to dream of <unk> .
so the basis for a lot of these are forms of technologies , and they grow them .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that becomes information technology is doing great leaps on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and it &apos;s doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less , and it &apos;s a thousand times a thousand faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it is -- in good ways , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
furthermore , despite your logarithmic <unk> on the left side it &apos;s up .
so the rate of growth itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that &apos;s called my friends in autodesk <unk> , and sensors and networks , robots , that allow us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , synthetic biology , synthetic biology , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory from <unk> supercomputer watson ?
and that was great .
i took time <unk> the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love these : &quot; watson <unk> human opponents . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would be available to each owner to each owner .
now four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies that are special on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services , which can affect the lives of billions of people in a decade .
think about that , you know , a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago that would have been ridiculous .
today we can have to have dozens of companies with dozens of companies .
when i think abundance of creating abundance , then i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of opportunity .
it &apos;s about creating a healthy goods abundance .
that scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource to <unk> power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he was invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> got <unk> .
aluminum was at that time the most precious metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome is made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> is not coming in as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of <unk> was developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s project this analogy for the future .
we &apos;re thinking about <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with more energy than we use a year .
<unk> of energy <unk> all 88 minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year .
last month , this is published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the u.s. solar energy is going to cost 60 cents a <unk> compared to 15 cents on the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , then we &apos;ll also have water as well .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> of 1990 , when it was <unk> at saturn , turned back towards earth ?
he took a famous photo . what was it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
we live on a planet that &apos;s about 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent , two percent is <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean <unk> , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , which is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and many of you may have heard of it . it &apos;s got the size of a <unk> .
it can generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water every day -- whether seawater , polluted water , <unk> -- and all that for less than two cents a gallon .
the president of coca-cola has right now to launch a big <unk> with a hundred units in the developing world .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola is going to apply to coca-cola in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
oh my goodness , we &apos;ll soon get the 70 percent of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just remember that a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya , in the middle of kenya , has a better <unk> than president reagan .
and if you look at google with your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information for president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in its abundance , as no one could have ever predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you &apos;ve spent , and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photo , libraries of medical diagnostics -- now , technology for medical diagnostics , now are literally <unk> and cheaper in their cell phone .
and the best part of this is perhaps what &apos;s going to be in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure called the &quot; $ 10 million <unk> , the x prize to announce .
we demand teams all over the world , to connect all these technologies together in a cell phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test or test your <unk> .
and to win , the device has to take a better diagnosis as a team of physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of health employees .
if this device sequenced a <unk> or <unk> sequence , which is not known to you , it calls the health center and prevents a pandemic .
but now the biggest force that we &apos;re going to do is lead to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and by the way , the largest <unk> against a population is a better upbringing and nutrition around the world .
in 2010 , we have just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to go from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new heads that we never heard before , will join a global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to desire ?
and instead of a standstill , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars to flow into the global economy .
and you &apos;ll be able to get into the use of <unk> healthier , and they &apos;re going to do better through the <unk> , and so they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d printers and as much more productive than ever before .
so , what can we get three billion , healthy , educated , more educated members of <unk> us ?
what about a sentence of new , never before <unk> voices .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to pay attention and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned through the x prize is that small teams that motivates and focus on , are extraordinary things , things that have big companies and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might be familiar with .
it &apos;s a game that has solved foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids , to study how the protein will evolve .
according to its behaviors , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by professors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern , better the proteins , and the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who is the best part of the world , this was not a <unk> , no <unk> , it was somebody from england , a woman , who was working as an assistant at the day of the <unk> in a <unk> , and was the best part of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i have incredible trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals today to provide the great challenges of our planet .
we have access with an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to address the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i believe that we have to do something about a medical piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time in business as i can give it a piece of my own false <unk> to give it this .
but before i come talking to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the center of the world , and we move to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; is soon and turns to statistics , and to use this to use a great baseball player .
i &apos;m going to share with a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about a 300 when a bat &apos;s beating .
that means that the player is beating by three beats .
this is called the ball of <unk> , it &apos;s coming up , and he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s tried to take on the first base , it hasn &apos;t done it on time , and it was in safety .
3 .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> cell ?
this is somebody in the rest of the rest of it safe .
<unk> -- like ted williams , <unk> <unk> -- the last <unk> of baseball player who met over 400 times over 400 times .
so let &apos;s go back to my world in the medicine of medicine , where i &apos;m going to feel more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less comfortable with you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;ll have a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they &apos;ve got a loved person with <unk> <unk> , and her <unk> <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> , which was <unk> at <unk> .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s much better that year . she &apos;s on the branch of a branch .
and she &apos;s beating a <unk> .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all the medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor .
but what we do , however , is that we locked each of them , including myself , in the world , are <unk> to be perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one does , though , the details of how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a compulsively <unk> student .
in high school , a school student said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the toronto , <unk> hospital , <unk> of here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and the tail of every single artery , every branch of a artery , which <unk> from the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and all the time , i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i went down to <unk> <unk> .
and i left the study of the impression that i knew , if i knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as much as possible , as much as possible that i was immune to making mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met a woman printer .
i &apos;m <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman printer , was brought to me in the <unk> of the hospital .
at that point , i was <unk> <unk> .
and it was my commission when the <unk> <unk> advice was looking for exploring the <unk> .
and to give feedback to my <unk> .
i looked at women printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to them , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest to the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she suffered under a <unk> failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails , instead of putting the entire blood down , puts a part of the blood flow in the lung , and filling it up , so the <unk> came out .
and that was not a difficult diagnosis .
i asked them , and i went to treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her a lot of medicine to take the pressure of hearts .
i gave her a lot of medicine that we call <unk> water , so they put the liquid <unk> .
and over a period of a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them back home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on them , and i did what i should have , what a call in my <unk> would be around with him so that he would have a chance to make a own picture .
and he knew her , he would have been able to get extra information to her .
maybe i did it for good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was like this , and i would be able to care about my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home , i got a quiet voice to me , trying to say to me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t it . &quot;
in fact , it was missing me so much to me that i asked the nurse , which is a printer taking care , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;ll go well . &quot;
i remember it as a story yesterday .
so i got the <unk> and an ambulance and an ambulance and <unk> and bring them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i packed my stuff , that hospital , and went to the parking lot to go home with the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went home through the <unk> on my home .
and then another one said another nurse , not the sister who had seen a printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear that i know that i know .
other doctors fear the same thing , but the <unk> is especially because we see the patients just like this .
three words loud : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you &apos;d like home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said to that particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and they die .
about an hour after she arrived at home , after i got her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and the <unk> took them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure on 50 , which is a dangerous thing .
she doesn &apos;t breathe , and it was blue <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them on the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was in the interior .
and i go through this rollercoaster , because she came after the <unk> to the <unk> , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , it realized she would never awakening again .
she had not suffered a <unk> .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they went to the <unk> .
on the day of the day , you <unk> them -- woman , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that the names of the world never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this himself .
the next couple of weeks , i claims , and i found that the first time in our medical shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you don &apos;t speak with the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame if you give a secret to the best friend of your best friend , even though this one can get on <unk> , and then you get it and the best friend , if you &apos;re having a terrible discussion , and you &apos;ll never take the bad argument , and you &apos;ll never do such a mistake .
if you do <unk> , and never make the mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy species i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in heart disease .
it &apos;s the one that says it &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason to me , he was very dear .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he <unk> <unk> and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why am i going to do it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly , but it &apos;s safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a day of a day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up , and i might tell myself better again .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and i would never <unk> a mistake that the voice could <unk> .
and she did it .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in a <unk> hospital in the north hospital , north of toronto , and i had a <unk> old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of go and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him away .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to have a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
and it turned out to be a <unk> .
he had a potentially potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but the top of the <unk> and causes them to keep the <unk> .
and luckily he died .
he got <unk> <unk> , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back again through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt me and went out and went back and over and over again and again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve missed two times an <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of things , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that had just 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i sent them back home , and there were probably no imperfections in their treatment .
i thought he thought he would have <unk> .
i took the <unk> of the kidneys , and it was without <unk> , my colleague , at the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient , found out there in the lower right sector , and called the <unk> .
the other one had a strong diarrhea .
i got <unk> <unk> to <unk> him , and i asked my colleagues too .
and he did , and when he turned out to the lower sector in the lower sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and they were good .
both cases <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years of what many of my colleagues say , but a total nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not going to end with my mistakes and talk about it , if i can talk about the silent voice , which is what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so they don &apos;t commit them ?
if i go into a room -- like now , i have no idea what she thinks about me .
when did you know the last time you heard about <unk> <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about your own mistake .
if i had a room full of colleagues , and i would ask her immediate support , and to begin to tell you what i just told you about , i wouldn &apos;t be very likely to do the end of the second story before it was really uncomfortable to come and forget the subject .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues know that a <unk> in my hospital would have taken someone the wrong leg , i think i &apos;d have trouble looking at the eyes .
that &apos;s the system where we live .
it &apos;s totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do , the people who <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and without <unk> , and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we do the ones that make mistakes in medicine that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical engineering and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study for medical error and wrong treatments to do so much for one of my first paper , which i did for the toronto , &quot; white <unk> , black kind .
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day in which , in which one of 10 is either a false or wrong thing , is always a false or <unk> , and it will become more and more and dead , devastation or dead .
in this state , around 24,000 canadians are dying of <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine has , at 100,000 .
both of them are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t think of the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a place where medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> and give it a little <unk> breath , and all of a sudden , the story of <unk> .
i don &apos;t take the same trajectory .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are inevitable errors .
so if you take the system so i &apos;ve been taught , and it &apos;s <unk> all the <unk> , then there &apos;s no one left .
and you know about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black style , &quot; i &apos;ve got the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everyone from the <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot;
and then you expand your pupils , they &apos;ve come across front of your head , look down and eat hard , and start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , do not the same mistakes that i &apos;m doing . &quot;
what you need is an environment that <unk> them in that position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the novel defined doctor is a human , white knows his humanity , accepted , is not proud to do mistakes , but they &apos;re going to learn something from them to be passed on .
she shares their experiences with others .
and it supports others from their mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a loving way , the supportive species that all of them will benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if it &apos;s like that , then people make mistakes in time .
so the system is going to be designed to create more powerful , which makes it easier to find errors that are inevitable , and it &apos;s also allowing allowing people to create supportive spaces , where everyone who &apos;s observing health mistakes , in fact , to actually address the potential of potential , which is a reward .
my name is brian <unk> .
i have defined a doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn from it to make it others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories before to use time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you probably know that he was <unk> here .
you may think that he blew up , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as very common .
it was a <unk> .
to the &apos; 80s in the &apos; 80s , he turned into great style .
now it &apos;s endangered species in the red list .
we &apos;ve heard this story many times a lot of times in the galapagos or in other places , it &apos;s not very special .
however , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they still describe the <unk> as pristine .
what happened here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept , <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced a lagoon when i studied a lagoon in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon was <unk> and a bunch of mangroves .
there were <unk> of about 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were good for them and made in ghana above average .
when i returned there , 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half its size .
grown , they measure five centimeters .
they were genetically engineered .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it has changed nothing , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story talks about my <unk> at southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the early &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe has a lot of <unk> .
<unk> meant the countries that started to have 100,000 fish that started industrial fishing , this pretty ugly ship &apos;s called <unk> fourth .
i went on to that , and we were <unk> all over the southern coast of ocean , and especially in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started there .
now i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially the bottom of the ocean was <unk> , and then became <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
within one year , you take a survey and then you start fishing with the commercial fishing .
the reason it &apos;s going to change . from this case -- a hard reason or the soft corals are <unk> crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat it , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started alive .
it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them .
in fact , this mountain of rubble will be <unk> to each other by fishermen every time they &apos;re driving into areas in which they &apos;ve never been involved .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our <unk> to the new level and don &apos;t give us what was there .
if you get it out , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
over time , it changes . it changes , because , of course , their actions are naturally .
each generation is looking at the images that they &apos;re beginning to take in their conscious life as the standard and becomes all of it .
the difference is perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be the order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s now largely our goal .
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are not like they were .
now , you could think that the problem of people was in <unk> societies , and they were killing animals , and they were aware of a few generations of what they did .
because it &apos;s obviously an animal that gave it very often , even rarely before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have a common animal .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as big loss .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals and the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re less likely to catch them .
over time , there are little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , confirm it was really different .
you &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as you are in a previous shape , are not as you would like to argue the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a <unk> report can &apos;t be used in this area , or it can &apos;t be used by <unk> , isn &apos;t usually <unk> because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in sophisticated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role to play a marine area .
because in <unk> , we basically think about the past .
we &apos;ve been asking the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the <unk> have changed and very low .
and so the people who see a marine reserve , and that will benefit from the insight that allows it to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who can &apos;t do that , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
here , i think the art and the film might be filling up the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think of why people have been touched by this -- except for the <unk> , why were you touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s been lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only ones i &apos;m going to give , is to cameron of cameron , which is &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the &apos; 80s , <unk> in the communist , you had to do if you had a typewriter you owned by government .
they also had to register a leaf from this typewriter .
the reason why the government could track , where a text came from .
found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would be about the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , you buy a new <unk> from the top of 2011 , and you print one side , this page light <unk> on each side , in a pattern , which is clearly the page on them and your printer .
this is what happens today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments are doing against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who have made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people have come online to wealth online , but they have been illegal by using <unk> , to steal money from our <unk> to claws while we &apos;re doing our <unk> on the keyboard , as we collected on an infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account for mr. sam jain here , and on this account were <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is a <unk> foot , which is unknown .
and i &apos;d argue that it &apos;s more likely to be that we become victims of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it &apos;s going to be even worse .
in the future , most crime will play online .
and the second largest <unk> that we can see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , an opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are doing the money for the money , <unk> such as anonymous , which is the resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are cases of <unk> .
it &apos;s an archetype that happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> in the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last fall it had to sign up <unk> , because <unk> was hacked .
somebody has been hacked and had the system <unk> .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior people asking the question of whether he was able to get it for possible because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people going to die in some such a hacks ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , you need a certificate , if you have a website with <unk> , <unk> service , for example .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these are particularly common in <unk> states like iran , where iran are using the accumulation of the vendor like gmail , because you know that they can &apos;t have more trust than the local government .
but can you be in a foreign foreign .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> quit hearing .
and that &apos;s exactly the case of <unk> .
what about the arab spring and the things that are happened in egypt for example ?
now , in egypt , in april , the u.s. headquarters in april 2011 , egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in that records , a folder was called <unk> .
and in this folder , notes in a <unk> company , the egyptian government sold a few programs that they were doing with -- in very large frame -- any communication of the egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments are providing <unk> governments with <unk> , so they can do it against their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , we found something called <unk> , which was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , you &apos;ll pretty much <unk> your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap into your internet connection .
they use resources like <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , to collect their <unk> .
so , if we continue to think about things like this , the obvious answer to people &apos;s answer is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has been given .
privacy is not to debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we , in 2011 , in 2011 , our governments , like trust , is every right that we &apos;re going to make .
and we trust , trust in any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to address the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made by <unk> , and <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> <unk> from cement , they fit .
<unk> have been very fast the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they gave us to build things that were larger than we were , buildings , the bridges , a stone after another .
essentially , the <unk> was a building block of our time .
nearly a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of lego .
it was called &quot; automatically <unk> stone . &quot;
and within less years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for everyone .
lego actually has the <unk> , the building block in the world , and it made a building block to our imagination .
in the meantime , the next year at bell labs have the next revolution , announced the next one .
the transistor was a little <unk> that would bring us from a world of static , <unk> building blocks of a world in which it would be interactive .
like the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex loops , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to study this idea of how you could put the power of artists in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , tone and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
you can &apos;t put them wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and they can build a very quickly larger <unk> .
they add a blue on one green , and they can make light .
and you can put a switch in between , and they made a little <unk> .
take the switch out to put a <unk> , which is here , and they made a little <unk> .
you put this <unk> for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
well , the simple thing is out , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , you &apos;re going to have to code , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to program them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to slow it down , or slow down , you just turn on this button , and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
and the idea behind that is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world in a <unk> stone .
lights , sounds , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve got <unk> of children , and we see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful , how do you start to understand the electronics that you see in the everyday life and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we also have <unk> <unk> .
so , for example , we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that started playing with <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we &apos;ve got risd to risd , and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait for this , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-doh that fear in the darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so <unk> is open source .
you can go to the website , you can download all the <unk> and make them .
we want to encourage the creators of the creators , the inventor , to encourage the <unk> , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , move on and start to invent them .
thank you .
