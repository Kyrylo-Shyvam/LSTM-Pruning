you know , one of the great <unk> in the travel , and one of the pleasure in the <unk> research is to live with the people who remember the old days , which is still in the wind that touch their past and touch them on the bitter sheets of plants .
you know , that <unk> is still beyond the milky way travels beyond the milky way , or the meaning of myths , the elders of the inuit are still full of meaning , or that the buddhist line has always been the breath of the <unk> to memory , which is the <unk> breath of anthropology to memory , which is the idea that the world that we have , though , is the <unk> of anthropology to memory .
and of course , we share all the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we &apos;ve got to deal with the separation between death , and so we should not surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a role in the forests of borneo in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara . this is the colleague i &apos;ve traveled to a month ago .
and all of these people teach us that there are other things that are more diverse , other ways of thinking about thinking about the earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only meet hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world are a network of <unk> and <unk> lives that are as important as the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you have as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and <unk> , as the <unk> of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , <unk> and intuitions that have been defined by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness have been defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we &apos;re capable of , and what we do as an amazing species of species .
and just as the biosphere became very much eroding , this happened with the <unk> -- just even bigger speed .
not a biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent or more of all species are about extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the field of biological diversity -- is now known as <unk> <unk> in the area of the cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when everybody was born in this room , were spoken on the earth &apos;s 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is the expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that will find access to the soul of a certain culture .
each language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey today , in fact , the half is not <unk> in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught more of the infants , which means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually already dead .
what could be more lonely than the silence to be <unk> , one of the people who talk to your language is not a way to give the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the wisdom of the ancestors ?
and yet this horrible fortune actually happens somewhere on earth somewhere on the earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older man dies and takes the last <unk> of an old language to the grave .
and i know some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better like this ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place , if we all talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a yoruba language . let them be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would see how it would be if you could not talk their own language .
that &apos;s why i want to take you through a trip through the <unk> , a short trip through the <unk> , to try to understand , to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now , there are some of us who forget that when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different possibilities of my own .
if you take this kid in the <unk> of the amazon forest , the people of the amazon , believe that they were <unk> the <unk> from the east by sacred snakes .
this is a people that aren &apos;t cognitively , between the colors of blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest is dependent upon the people .
they have a strange language , and a <unk> is called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who &apos;s talking to a different language .
all of this is rooted in the <unk> past , and the curious thing about these big houses where they &apos;re talking about six or seven languages , however , is that you never hear someone who learns a language .
and they just stop talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing people in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first time , he &apos;s the first time peaceful 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> were trying to get contact contact and made a <unk> mistake .
they threw <unk> photos from the air , what we would grade as a friendly gesture , and you forgot that these people out of the rainforest in their lives have never seen something in their lives .
they took this photographs from the forest floor , tried to look at the face or the character , they didn &apos;t find anything and <unk> that there were business cards and killing the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t just kill in the phone with the spear .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of deaths happened by <unk> .
we went back to eight generations , and they found two cases of a natural death rate , and when we did a <unk> <unk> , they gave one of the people that died that he died , and we were killing it anyway .
but at the same time , they had a clear <unk> of forests that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps , and determine which animal species owned .
in the early years , i got a really amazing task , when my professor at harvard asked , whether i was going to go to haiti and to infiltrate the secret societies , which were the foundation of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the poison that was used to make <unk> , making sure .
so , to give you a sense of that <unk> , i had to know something about this remarkable belief and <unk> , which is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i ask you to ask them the great world leaders , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> , whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith , and of course it &apos;s a very profound religious thought , in during the tragic diaspora of <unk> <unk> .
but what &apos;s so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
living the way to living the spirits .
the spirits out of the big water <unk> , respond to the rhythm of dance to be temporary to the soul of the living , so that the <unk> for a short <unk> moment is to the god .
<unk> say , &quot; your white go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with that mind , how can you cause damage to it ?
you see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , which <unk> coal without burning combustion , an amazing visualization of the mind of the mind to influence the body so that it &apos;s <unk> if it &apos;s <unk> in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met was the <unk> from the sierra nevada , santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the ancient <unk> civilization that went from the caribbean <unk> of colombia , and in the aftermath of the conquest , they moved this people into a <unk> <unk> mass that &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the <unk> .
until today &apos;s day , they are governed by a ritual priesthood , but the education of education is very extraordinary .
the boys are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> on the base of the glacier for 18 years , <unk> for 18 years , chose to mimic the nine months of pregnancy , spent now , to mimic the nine months of pregnancy .
and during all this time , they &apos;re a culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that their prayers , and only their prayers , the cosmic cosmic -- or we could maintain the ecological -- balance .
at the end of these amazing trials , you &apos;ll eventually get out of the outside , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness , all of a sudden , everything that starts learning in the abstract of the amazingly beautiful landscape , all of a sudden , everything you learned in the abstract , amazing glory .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
and whenever we think about native and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> and the old fraction of the fancy wild <unk> , which , in his simplification , is a <unk> thought , or thoreau and say , these people are more associated with nature than us .
so , aboriginal people are neither <unk> , they &apos;re still going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s not a lot of place in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the <unk> winds of tibet , however , but yet , in time and ritual a mysterious <unk> of the earth , which doesn &apos;t come to the idea of being aware of it , but at a very <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s going into human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means a little child from the andes , which is growing up in a belief that the mountain is a <unk> , to be able to determine , will be a whole other person , and a different relationship with montana , or the place , as a small child , or the place , is going to be a bunch of rocks , and that place , as a small child , and it can be eroding .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which is the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia and believed that these forests are there to become <unk> .
that made me a different person than my friends under the <unk> who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> spirits out and the <unk> spirits out to the <unk> of the world , ghosts that they were involved in their <unk> .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph that i was just taking my last april in april of the amazon forest .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful risk of the <unk> repertoire .
what &apos;s so fascinating , it &apos;s not just the most powerful potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s actually made of two different sources , and on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden <unk> , which is a series of wooden <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this plant contains a lot of very strong ones that are serotonin , <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
once you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , you &apos;ve seen that stuff , that substance that you create in different ways are also <unk> .
to <unk> this powder is kind of like being shot out of a <unk> , <unk> from <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
in fact , i &apos;ve even been with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who gave the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic mushrooms to the discovery of the magical mushrooms in mexico in the <unk> years , and i argued that if you can &apos;t put it as a <unk> in the moment where you feel the impact , you &apos;re not there to experience a <unk> .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be picked up , because in a human gut , of course it &apos;s called <unk> enzyme called <unk> , <unk> .
they can only be taken into connection with some other chemicals that mao <unk> .
now the fascinating thing is that the most amazing thing is that the <unk> , which are in the <unk> , are <unk> of exactly the kind that are necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask themselves .
how can these people from a kind of 80,000 species of 80,000 species of 80,000 plants are not able to find the related plants that are combined by doing a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and mistakes , which it turns out to be meaningless .
but if you ask the indians , they say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> , which you see all of the distance in the woods in the forest that looks for our eyes as a kind of thing .
and then you ask them how they justify their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understand some of the plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you can take each of the 17 variants at <unk> , and they sing them singing in a different <unk> .
now that doesn &apos;t take you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem of the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult situation , they have a <unk> and <unk> , but you can look at the past as the real world , but the real world , which means the real world , the <unk> .
so the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century in 300 years in 300 years in 300 years , but rather than an era where we &apos;ve sat in and the massive destruction of the earth is either active supported or passive , so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> stopped being less for sioux , when they get bow and arrow , when americans stopped americans when they stopped the horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you see in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not going to be the extinction of the extinction , these are dynamically living peoples whose existence of <unk> forces will be <unk> by the capacity of <unk> , whether it &apos;s been <unk> to the capacity of deforestation , whether it &apos;s been <unk> to the capacity of deforestation , whether there was a people who lived in a generation of the forest , whether it &apos;s been free to the <unk> of the forest .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m <unk> a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people will be convicted in general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people &apos;s lives , not only is not only convicted , but in general and <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering and not understand that if you haven &apos;t experienced it on a <unk> level .
i once traveled with a young colleague <unk> miles from <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> <unk> , and when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear -- 6,000 sacred monuments , who were murdered in rubble to the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as the <unk> lama .
that meant that he had immediately killed during the chinese invasion .
so , his uncle bug with your holiness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up as punishment for -- for the crime .
he was smuggled in jail at the age of two years to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister who did this brave did , was brought into a <unk> .
she stepped on a <unk> <unk> , and they had to <unk> them for seven years in a heavy camp .
the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> mind of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really going to stand in front of a choice . do we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said before she died , that it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we &apos;re in the direction of a thread , <unk> , <unk> worldview , we &apos;re not just going to reduce the entire range of human imagination in a <unk> way , but we have forgotten that there &apos;s ever any other opportunity .
and it &apos;s humbling to think about it that our species have been there for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us into agriculture , and at this moment , the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of <unk> <unk> , and specialization , specialization and surplus created -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we are in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these <unk> <unk> for the importance of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness , who are the importance of all people and gardens to all people and gardens , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern <unk> of the <unk> , when i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and during the years of the <unk> of our rule , they were forced to move in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> of the sledge were originally made out of fish which was made in <unk> .
and the guy &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear himself before the arctic night or the <unk> storm .
he went outside , made his pants from <unk> down and <unk> into his hand , and when the feces started to freezing , he formed them in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the side of the <unk> , and it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog , <unk> <unk> , <unk> another dog , and <unk> on the <unk> with the <unk> belt .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the native of the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 <unk> the complete control of an area bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new homeland , called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the <unk> .
it &apos;s an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for themselves and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these distant goals in the earth , to realize they &apos;re not removed at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , how the dreams of our own children is part of the geography of hope .
so what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not convincing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling storytelling . our website gets 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we do a series of trips in the <unk> , where we take our audience in places like this cultural wonder that they think of the issue blind , and hopefully , you &apos;ll assume one after the others of the <unk> anthropology , that this world has to contribute to different ways that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i &apos;m starting to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have as a result of a <unk> <unk> in a year ago , and that &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s an environment where it &apos;s either local or a huge amount of visual data .
we see many , a lot of books at digital photographs here , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in all ways .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are photographs of a camera , but this one here is a scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a field of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that the performance can be like this is the number of pixel on their screen in every moment , and it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not to be a picture , we can actually do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and these are really giving them the pleasure and the good experience a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium of magnitude scales .
we &apos;ve also done something at this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false ad with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we added more content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or some models , or even technical specs .
and this is really reaching these ideas to end these limitations for the available space on the screen .
we hope that that &apos;s not a <unk> and other nonsense of that -- that should not be necessary .
and of course , this is mapping the really <unk> applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we will be contributing to this area .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
<unk> up on the <unk> image of nasa .
now let &apos;s now get something out of it .
this is now live on the internet now . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which actually connects two different technologies to each other .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , who from noah <unk> , at a <unk> university at the university of steve <unk> on the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
and you can see that , if we create these kinds of views , where we can penetrate through images and make that experience of the <unk> resolution .
but the spatial structure , in fact , is because of meaning .
they were <unk> these images together with the real space that these shots were made near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , right , and you can see elements of <unk> slides or <unk> <unk> , and these things have all been set up in space .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much <unk> .
i &apos;d like to go straight one of the <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> where we first worked in the summer , to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology that &apos;s really the punchline that we have on the website .
we had to make us worry about and so on .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral of notre dame , who was hit entirely in the computer with flickr , and they just notre notre lady in flickr , and they get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> , each of this orange cone represents a picture that was discovered as this model .
so all of these are <unk> , and they &apos;re all in space in the way that each other relationship .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft eventually .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception reception .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : it &apos;s all about the <unk> to professional <unk> , a fairly large number of them that are all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the odd ones .
a lot of them are covered on faces .
so , there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;ll now collected data from all -- from all the collective memory of how visual the earth looks -- and everything is being connected .
all these photographs are connected , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s through complexity that people use it , grows and use it for the user to get bigger .
their own photos are going to be with metadata with metadata , which has a different model .
if anybody did the effort and all those saints and tell you who you all are , then my picture of <unk> <unk> suddenly <unk> all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this space , and then we can use it as a point of using the other <unk> experience .
and of course , byproduct of all of these are the tremendously rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not only given by <unk> or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
did i get you right ? your software enables at a certain point , within the next few years , all the images that are together in the world are going to be together in principle , in principle ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if they want to do , they create <unk> between the images .
and it does this because of the content .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of the <unk> information that many of these images have .
how if you do a <unk> for images , where you enter sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about that , which is the picture .
but what would it be like if the picture is associated with all their images ?
then the amount of <unk> <unk> and the abundance that comes out of it , is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book , as i hope , in harmony with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections if you haven &apos;t noticed .
i want to start with what i call official <unk> .
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all the western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is to maximize the good of our citizens , this is all about the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , meaning , a more important assumption for human .
when people have freedom , each of us is to do for themselves to do the things that maximize our benefit and nobody has to decide for us .
the way freedom to maximize is maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common you have .
this is , i think , as deep in our water <unk> , that it would not come to question .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . this is not a big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my grocery store , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different extra days and you don &apos;t get 12 people who could make them buy a huge amount of your own <unk> , in the unlikely case that none of the 175 in the store for you .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> store to a stereo stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , amplifier , and in that there &apos;s a electronics store that &apos;s so many <unk> facilities .
we can put together <unk> million different <unk> plants out of the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a young boy , and you could have been involved in the phone every phone , as long as he came from ma
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
and one episode was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now in your business , you can be sure they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it causes people to walk into the business and ask that question .
you know what the answer is that ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , not too much .
in other aspects of life , which are very much more powerful than buying objects , makes the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , if you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do b or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a <unk> , and b , has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you &apos;re saying , &quot; if you were , &quot; if you were , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it the patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the burden of responsibility for someone who knows a little bit -- <unk> the doctor -- and most likely , it &apos;s not the best way to make any decision -- <unk> the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing for people like you and me , that if you think about it at all , it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you &apos;re expecting to call the next morning and ask to ask a change of change .
and something like our identity is now a question of choice , to show you the slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity ; we invent it .
and we &apos;re very often <unk> ourselves .
that means that every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everybody had one , and they were able to <unk> as quickly as they could , and then get children as fast as they could .
the only real choice was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not when they did .
it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i marry now ?
should i get married later ? should i have children , or do that career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m doing to you and not get a good note in my class .
and in fact they should do that . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl illustrates , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every space on the planet , until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work in terms of work , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our cell phone to go to the hip and our blackberry at other hip and our blackberry at other hip and our laptop .
and also , if you &apos;re all shut down , every minute in which we <unk> our child at the <unk> of a <unk> , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be their experience of the human child &apos;s experience very differently .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived in this way .
and i want to say there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world in which we &apos;re living now .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be a bad thing about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> , is that it <unk> <unk> instead .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s going to be very difficult to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of a study of investing in volunteers in volunteers .
one of me had access to the <unk> of <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million collaborators and about 2,000 jobs .
and what she found was that what she found was that the employers <unk> , it took a participation by two percent .
they provide 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees than if you offer five , why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are so hard to decide to decide what to choose to put it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , it never comes .
you can understand that this is not just that you have to eat food food if they don &apos;t go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to travel , it also means that they miss a lot of decisions that they miss large <unk> of your employers .
because they can &apos;t participate up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> who had been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to make the decision right if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the <unk> investment in the back , or at all the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of the selection , than if we had the opportunity to decide between less opportunities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is taking up by the great choice of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that &apos;s a perfect point ? it &apos;s just to imagine that they could have been a different decision that would have been better , and what happens is that the <unk> <unk> gives you a decision that they made the better decision .
the more opportunities there are , the more it &apos;s going to be more to regret at all , which is disappointing you meet .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has done a great point in this morning by telling how much the way that we grade things about what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to remember , it &apos;s simply to be attractive properties of alternatives that make them all , that makes them less happy with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
so here &apos;s a couple to the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve got it for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spending two weeks from the thought that he has missed the opportunity to have a great parking lot .
<unk> lower happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more options that there are choices , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take into account in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he &apos;s making a statement about it in now , and perhaps things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing : always who you decide to do for one thing , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive traits , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do to make less powerful .
third , <unk> of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was just a time in which there were only jeans , and they &apos;ve bought them , and they have <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had a long enough , and if they had a long time , they started to go &quot; ok .
so , to buy new jeans , after many years of the senior old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the guy said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , slightly <unk> or high ?
do you mean the buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid ?
do you want to leave jeans .
if you want to cut down , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i would have like , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way the only species was . &quot;
he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour all of these damn <unk> , and that &apos;s the business -- and i say the truth -- the best appropriate jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all this choice allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain to myself .
the reason that i felt worse was that i was a bad thing to do with all these options , my expectations for what a good couple of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete when they were in a way .
when you came in 100 ways , damn it would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i had to get to what i expected , and what i had had was disappointing to what i expected .
the adding opportunities in the lives of human beings , inevitably the expectations of people have , how good are they going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what it is here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it used to be better than anything worse than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to make experience a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , <unk> citizens , with perfection -- the best thing you can ever hope is that things are as good as you might .
they &apos;re never pleasant because of your expectations , my expectations .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all have come -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a brief moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> is not always such a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of a bad sitting on a bad sitting , if there &apos;s only one way to buy is that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask yourself why who &apos;s responsible , the answer is , the world is responsible . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you &apos;re buying a <unk> , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people are making decisions , and also when the results of decisions are good , they &apos;re <unk> disappointed themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the <unk> world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned that there are so disappointing , and then , if you have to explain this experience , think it would be your fault .
and so the <unk> is that it &apos;s better at us , generally , is objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> that we all think is wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than no , but it &apos;s not that the more choice is better than something selection .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this period for a long time to improve our greater good .
now , as an policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as an policy question , the thing about thinking about thinking is that all of these choices allowed in the industrialized societies , is the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , whose problem is not that big choice .
your problem is they have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a curious issue of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying , steve <unk> has told you about how these expensive and hard to <unk> car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help .
they &apos;re even hurt .
you worry that we are worse .
if something of our society enables us to make so decisions to the societies in which people had little choices , wouldn &apos;t only improve the lives of human beings , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this an <unk> application .
<unk> is going to make sure that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of this great choice of us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
they don &apos;t know anything in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to think that the fish is something .
because the truth is that when they break it down , it &apos;s all possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break it down , it &apos;s all possible , you lower happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost as perfect as limited -- probably for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects already before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
we &apos;re actually starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by building new life and build new life .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists are trying to understand and this on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different ways to make it simplify the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years , and when we sequenced the <unk> , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate life , or whether we can make new life from this digital universe ?
this is a map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , which is the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes to the 500 of the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our comparison . but if we look at all these genes that we can see one else is very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
and so we decided that it &apos;s the only way forward , it &apos;s the only way to synthesize the individual components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesizing a chromosome ?
is it possible to create these chemistry really large molecules , what has never done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in <unk> is exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been <unk> very slowly , but also increased , and our last point is going to put up on an exponential curve .
we started about 15 years ago .
it was actually a couple of years starting with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
and as it turns out , it turns out it &apos;s very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more errors happen .
so we had to develop a new way of developing these little pieces and to correct these little pieces of the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
we made little pieces , and we made a <unk> molecule , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
and the exciting stage came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and put into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then open by the cells , and they came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said it &apos;s exactly this model .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think that this is a situation in software , actually , in software , in fact , in a biological system .
but we wanted to go on a lot . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome , and it &apos;s got more than <unk> letters of genetic code , and so we thought we &apos;re building it in cassette tapes from the size of the virus , where we could vary the scale of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome at the first time in 1995 , the <unk> was a mistake of a 10,000 base base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 mistake , and if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have to overlap with other <unk> pieces , to build smaller <unk> to make these match .
we have unique elements in here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> into this <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these characters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we &apos;ve just signed .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
so we designed the pieces so that we could just break them down with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair and bring together together .
and we &apos;ve started to make pieces , starting with the pieces of five to <unk> characters in each other , put those together in each other to <unk> this again , to <unk> them .
in each step , we have produced these pieces in the brain that we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
when we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli , and it &apos;s beyond all the possibility of modern molecular biology , and so we put together other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called <unk> <unk> that uses biology to repair dna that can create these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million wheel of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it took each other like this .
we have thousands of organisms to do that .
these organisms can be <unk> , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move , looking for conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used <unk> with the right design of the pieces , we put them down , and then yeast put it automatically .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the <unk> .
this is footage from six seconds .
this is the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
that &apos;s about <unk> letters in the <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure ever created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it up with a $ 10 of 10 and without the distances , it would include <unk> pages , just about this genetic code .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , and it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s as much as we &apos;re going to do it as we &apos;re doing it , and you just take the nucleus out , and there &apos;s a different in there , and that &apos;s exactly what you all have heard about this .
in fact , the chromosome into the cell is the chromosome into the cell , but it &apos;s just recently that we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete chromosome from one cell to another one cell to the other .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> , roughly said , are these two , as humans and mice , and we gave some <unk> to destroy the chromosome . we <unk> it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing to destroy all the proteins .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get a little further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here , and we &apos;ve got a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands and thousands of things in just a second .
so people who think about evolution as a gene has been missing a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are called the <unk> <unk> that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was <unk> in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , and so we ended up a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and <unk> completely into a new species of software that we gave in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re talking about .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new kind of a cambrian explosion where there might be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re about a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has been born for anybody who has been in 1946 , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel fuel for six billion people .
it will be a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion drums of oil , that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is all carbon co2 from this material that goes into the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and see the diversity that came out of it .
we are in the first line in the boundaries of biological reality , and that of our imagination .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of these fast <unk> , to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we &apos;ve now got the opportunity to build a big robot for the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you think about these 20 million different genes , or to create these processes , to create <unk> , or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a shot from the actual work that we &apos;re working with that you actually sit down and <unk> new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it is . we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn ethanol recently , which is a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got fuels from the <unk> and third generation that will have much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way to do biology has a huge impact on the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as the material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that are going to be the way to go .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re looking at if we can use carbon dioxide that could easily be brought into <unk> , the co2 in the fuel could be able to power that process .
within a short period of time we think we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of all the <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a <unk> of energy .
but the way we &apos;re working at now is the same approach to use vaccines right now .
you &apos;ve seen it that year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back in the back , and you have a dollar too little , if it goes to the right vaccine .
i think that this can be changed by using <unk> vaccines in <unk> .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes , it can accelerate today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we are light years from it to improve people . our goal is only to survive long enough to survive that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who haven &apos;t been there , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment that has ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second in the universe existed -- and that &apos;s going to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> into detectors .
i &apos;m working on that . it &apos;s called atlas up -- 44 meters in diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas of the atlas that you see the scale .
ten of september last year , the machine ran for the first time .
and this picture was taken from atlas .
it caused huge amounts of water in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first one of the first route that all the way around the lhc is to <unk> with a piece of the lhc to make a piece of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if it was producing the largest oil industry , or this , when somebody went to google side and found the front page .
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the science .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that wires had to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires lead to <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
now , the engineers under you will look at and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cool them down very far , they &apos;re called the <unk> .
so , minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between stars , can be able to withstand tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnet at the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and so , it heat up the wires , and the wires , suddenly , had <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is another amazing thing when you imagine that the magnets would weigh over 20 tons and to move around an inch .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it out , and we &apos;re expecting to collect the first data in june or july , and we have our journey on to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way , in a way , such accidents , the debate about the value of science and <unk> of these things , it &apos;s easy to reject something like that .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard that we reach beyond our borders , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to an english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i guess when he was the <unk> <unk> of his <unk> defended , his apprentice was michael <unk> , which said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of his mind , which said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind , and that there &apos;s no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to ever change .
however , the recent thing in my life , and my career has happened to make me rethink my relationship with this work completely .
this curious event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , decided different than all of the previous books had gone into the world , and a big <unk> , the international <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was going to be <unk> .
seriously -- the extinction !
for example , you get a very concerned thing to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never <unk> that success ?
don &apos;t you fear their whole life , and you can never create a book , you create the anyone in the world ?
okay , that &apos;s really doing the power .
however , it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that , that i was about 20 years ago , when i first told them that i was going to be a writer with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> are you not afraid to have succeeded ?
don &apos;t you fear you killing the humiliation of a <unk> ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to get a lot of life on this craft , and you never come up with that , and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ?
you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;m afraid of all more things that nobody would see .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but when it &apos;s about writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this and ask me , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that from someone should be expected to be afraid of doing the work that he feels ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprises do , that they make ourselves insecure about the other state of state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about it ?
it just wasn &apos;t , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists did not receive the <unk> call of <unk> people .
but we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the kind of creative of all <unk> , seem to be the <unk> that &apos;s mentally tremendously unstable .
all you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great heads alone from the 20th century , who died young and many times .
and even those who don &apos;t actually <unk> them , they seemed to be really neglected from their talents .
norman <unk> just said his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books had killed me a little bit more .
it &apos;s an extraordinary statement that you can do about their work .
but we don &apos;t even know when we hear somebody saying something like that , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements for such a long time . somehow we have the perception and collectively , that creativity and suffering , of course , that creativity and suffering , of course , that creativity and suffering is always <unk> .
the question i want to ask for everyone here is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you think it &apos;s going to feel ? because at only one centimeter , i feel like , i feel , i feel like this .
i think they were <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t see how she &apos;s taken over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we live our great creative projects .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start , to start with this dark path of the guess -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that means -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to be about to write from the world as the work , which was the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here now -- it &apos;s probably probably my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
this is the kind of thought that can bring someone to start at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , gin to drink , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would prefer to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some of the time , i seem to be able to keep writing about to be able to design a kind of <unk> psychological construction .
in some way , i have to find a way of writing a secure distance between me and my very natural <unk> of how the reaction is going to be on the writing .
so while i was looking for models in the past year for models to do that , i &apos;ve been looking for , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they could be able to deal with the emotional risks , to deal with the emotional risks that are associated with creativity .
this is a search that led me into old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up .
but in the old greece and rome in rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity is coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source to humans -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> demons .
from socrates , he believed that he would have had a <unk> , he was telling him a little bit about it .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative mind a <unk> genius .
this is great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they thought that a genius was this kind of magical <unk> creature that was believed that literally live in the walls of a <unk> -- sort of like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> , and the artist , in a way , was invisible to work , and the outcome of the work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the follow of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist &apos;s <unk> was protected , like , for example , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was a <unk> .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity in the west .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room to pick up the mystic creatures taking orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people began to believe that creativity completely came from its own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear this one or artists that artists call a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person allows you to think that he or it was like the gourd , like the basin and the essence , and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , infinite <unk> , is a little bit too much responsibility to make a little bit too much responsibility .
it &apos;s like somebody to swallow the sun .
that <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> has wiped out our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t rational for 500 years from 500 years of <unk> .
and there are certainly people in this audience who really are really <unk> scientific doubt about the notion of -- essentially -- <unk> , people who are <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to do is : why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it makes sense like anything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows it &apos;s ever trying to do something -- so in other words , everyone here is -- not always behaves , not ever .
in fact , it can really feel like a <unk> .
i had a recent encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , which is now about 90 , but she told me she was a poet in the fields of him , and she told me that she was working on the fields in virginia , she told me that she was working on the fields .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
she would <unk> over the land .
she felt when it came , because it would get the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could just do that in a moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> races like the devil .
she ran like the devil on her house as she &apos;s been tracked by this poem , and it was just that they had to get fast enough to a paper and get to a pen , so she could capture it , and they could capture on the paper .
at others , they weren &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get to the house , and the poem rolled through her , and she missed it , and she told him to look over the country .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget -- and she said that there were moments where they were almost missed .
so , she runs to the house and looking after paper , and the poem drives through her , and she picks up a pen when it comes through and then -- she said -- it was like it was like to grab your other hand after it and get it .
she caught the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back in her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and in those opportunities , the poem came out and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i thought , this is creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i have to stand up every day at the same time and sweating , <unk> , and really uncomfortable me .
but even in my <unk> , sometimes i have this thing <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done this .
even i had work , and i had ideas that made out of a source through me that i can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how do we have to lose our minds without losing our minds , but in the contrary , in intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can create this is the musician tom <unk> . i was allowed to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom , the embodiment of the modern modern artist , who was trying , these <unk> creative impulses that lived in and help with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that he was driving a day on a freeway , and it changed everything for him .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly hear a little patch of a tune , which , as it is , very often , is difficult for him to be physical , and he wants them . it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . he can &apos;t grab it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen ; he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so , he starts to rise to this old <unk> of him , like i &apos;m going to get to lose this thing and will be tracked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he was finishing the whole of thought , and he did something completely new .
he just looked into the sky and said , &quot; <unk> excuse me , can &apos;t see that i &apos;m driving a car ?
<unk> look like i &apos;m just going to write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , <unk> today today .
go and <unk> cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him , took me out when he took the genius out of it , where he did nothing as anger , and then <unk> him where it was not a <unk> , <unk> thing .
there could be a <unk> , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , physical thing , that &apos;s not quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked , and i &apos;ve rescued it before .
i saved this idea when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell into one of these these these specimens that fall in , when we &apos;re working on something , when we &apos;re working on something , and you &apos;re starting to think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this becomes the worst book .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , well , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i raised my view from the manuscript and i talked about my comment on a empty corner of space .
i spoke loud : <unk> listen , you and i , you both know , if this book wasn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , i don &apos;t have any more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up and follow the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to make a report that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like followed , in centuries ago , to <unk> people with sacred dances and music , the hours , the hours of <unk> -- to dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again and again , very rare , what happened is , one of the performers actually became <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen such a performance in your life .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancers would walk through a kind of <unk> , and he did nothing different than he has ever done before -- 1,000 nights ago . but everything was added .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t appear in human .
it was lit up from the inside , and it &apos;s lit up from the bottom , and it &apos;s all <unk> through a <unk> fire .
as something that happened then , people knew what this was . they called it his name .
they put their hands together and they started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came together , they brought this practice with , and the pronunciation changed over the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still hear about <unk> and <unk> .
if a performer in spain has something impossible , what magic has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , well , done a <unk> view of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part is the next morning when the dancers wakes up himself and see that 11 o &apos;clock is on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knee , and maybe he will never get to these heights up to that heights .
and maybe there &apos;s never going to be any of god &apos;s name if he &apos;s spinning . but what would he start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence came from them .
if you may just believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source of your life that will be passed on to someone else when they &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking so this is all changing .
so i started thinking , and so i think of security in the last few months , while i was working on the book , it &apos;s going to appear -- than the dangerous , frightening , really , the most expected successor to my <unk> success .
what i have to tell myself is that if i &apos;m crazy about it , i &apos;m not afraid .
not <unk> .
just do your job .
be there for your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is to dance , dance .
if the silly divine genius that you put on the page , decides for a brief moment to show a <unk> of wonder , then <unk> <unk> !
and if not , dance still , yet dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you despite all of this .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you despite all of this , just for the mere human love and the <unk> to be there for that .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i &apos;ve shown these two slides to illustrate this , that the arctic school , that had about three million years of the bottom of 48 states , had shrunk to 40 million .
but this doesn &apos;t press strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in the winter and <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> thing in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is with red .
as you can see , it grows on <unk> . this is the annual ice of ice in winter , and it &apos;s just declining in summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming is the frozen cause around the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of carbon dioxide in which there &apos;s large amounts of carbon dioxide , which if it &apos;s implemented , of microbes .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> material in the atmosphere , it could double when we cross that critical point .
already today in some flat lakes in alaska , alaska from itself in alaska .
professor <unk> walter university in alaska has gone to a different <unk> lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to <unk> us .
and one reason is , this tremendous heat <unk> greenland from north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is essential than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know , like the level of sea level , it goes into the ocean here .
these rivers take a quick .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that showed up on a few <unk> , is particularly the melting of melt .
this fits 20 feet like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the top of the lakes that was glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
they have been expanding .
but when they &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s also going to <unk> most of the water .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in the sierra sierra industry .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
so this <unk> in the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have actually gained in a really <unk> , and in a really unprecedented extent .
four times so many over the last 30 years , as many over the last 30 years .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , right , from the american continent western and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there is a dramatic decline of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , alongside deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the other biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of more <unk> .
but we begin to see a change .
here are the ones that were eliminate over the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar <unk> to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , at christmas time , in my home , in my home , a billion tons of <unk> .
you saw it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america in america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the commercials &apos;s commercials for christmas .
<unk> is a <unk> , a happy guy .
there &apos;s a <unk> in the skin and abundance of america , and it &apos;s helping our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> is <unk> every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers are <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
so let me clearly say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so , the alliance for climate protection has started .
this is one , a part of her .
we see climate change as a serious danger in our business .
that &apos;s why we set up to the top <unk> , a significant <unk> to spend a <unk> on the path to the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s still smelling .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
so let &apos;s leave that .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of the coal of one of the main reasons is the global warming , the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
look at it right now , this is the <unk> <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all binds together is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this kind of <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work , to make us secure and help us stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on the old <unk> , messy fuels , that <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to do well paying jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start with you to ask you , at the time of your childhood , when they were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how to reach the hands of hands , and <unk> that <unk> and move , they actually learned to think about thinking and problems through understanding and changing <unk> ideas .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleague <unk> <unk> , i started wonder : what if we could use computers , which moves like a digital <unk> to a flat <unk> -- -- what if we could intervene in the computer to intervene on a flat <unk> ...
and this question was so emotional , that we decided to try and developed the answer to the answer and evolved .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can be moved with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your movements and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important is physically why you can only move them out of your hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools become physical and the awareness of their movements develop each other and see each other , and we can see the subtleties of our <unk> , then we can start to start exploring new and entertaining .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> , and when i put it in a direction , the video goes forward ; when i run it into the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so when i put them side-by-side , you get interested .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you &apos;ll notice it can be a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and tilt .
so , an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data like color as they do in the way that it does with liquids .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color into the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we overdo it , we can <unk> a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast and error and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a series that i &apos;m making with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , every round of all of you get to get <unk> letters , and as you try to form words , they &apos;ll be tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s got back and you have a new <unk> and a new opportunity to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and try it and have a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is words , and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> right there .
and it turns out he wanted to just stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by <unk> the table from the table to this character .
here he lets the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he makes a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good job ! yes !
he &apos;s shaking the <unk> and shake the side by side by side to each other .
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it &apos;s evolved .
flying cat .
the last example that i have time for today is to show it &apos;s a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve been developing recently , and in the <unk> as a notes , like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these sounds into the sequence that you can put in any patterns .
and you &apos;re <unk> them by just putting a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
and you connect him with a particular note , and then it tends to be hiring .
and then there &apos;s still increasing effects like speed and volume that you do in the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to put up the <unk> in two <unk> and this in a row , expand and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something about that .
and now i combine the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the speed into one or another .
and now i combine the filter , with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it happens .
and so i don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , it can improvise ; it &apos;s going to extend increasing .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by looking at the <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new <unk> that are better to fit the way our brains and body work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
and the idea that i want to give you to the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of <unk> to interaction with digital media to bring information to the world that &apos;s going to our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m pleased to be there .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i just have to first step back , and that &apos;s busy in terms of the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology and a couple of years now for a few years now , and i &apos;ve been starting to know , because i just wanted to know and do it in the study of what i &apos;ve learned in studying theory .
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i just wanted to get closer to the matter .
i think that molecular biology in general now is speaking in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , it &apos;s already extremely important , and even more , much more important , will be more important .
there are so controversial things like all of these genetically engineered plants .
there are craig venter now in the <unk> who &apos;s trying to make <unk> , so gas out of algae .
now , there are things that are totally arrived in the whole world , which most people don &apos;t even realize , for example , for example , that allow us to wash with 40 degrees of laundry , also genetically engineered enzymes .
and the list can continue on endlessly .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m just going to move on .
so what kind of <unk> ?
most people know that most people know this from the <unk> .
so the computer <unk> , and then it will be like that , and the hacker , the hacker , in fact , the hacker somewhere and claws data and so forth .
it &apos;s kind of a very sad thing to do it , because it doesn &apos;t happen at all , what it really did , what it actually started , and what &apos;s actually going on .
and in fact , the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a sense of things that can make things like things , which is a question of <unk> , and how can you make it better or how to do that .
and it turns out that it &apos;s got stuck with software , but there &apos;s also in <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that &apos;s going to do with <unk> all kinds of stuff .
and now even in biology , and that &apos;s where i want this metaphor to take out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a <unk> code , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s more dynamic , which is a matter of matter .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can code that , and you can actually hack it into it , so you can find it , and that &apos;s what i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
now , it &apos;s actually actually <unk> eight to the form , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india in india , which is now members or active people around the world .
that &apos;s a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and working together with scientists in working with scientists , to try and process with these technologies and the creative , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always about trying to find such a <unk> access to have a kind of playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> dotcom , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of a network , which is actually more like a forum where you &apos;re going to meet and talk online .
they &apos;re a little technical approach and a little bit of <unk> on the way , and then they &apos;re going to be asked , <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that have been the most popular thing , it &apos;s actually developed a scene that i &apos;d like to make a little bit more like .
here &apos;s a picture on the left on the left , which is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , a kind of a school , a private school , where everyone can get to .
kids , old , all kinds of people going around and just go through , they set up a lab and look at what you can do when these <unk> are .
there &apos;s a group in indonesia on the left here , <unk> , which is , but there &apos;s a pretty long time .
even longer than those other networks .
and these are also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , <unk> , and combine it in a pretty <unk> way .
there &apos;s a group from ankara that i &apos;ve met in a while ago , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> that would like to convey more to the public , what they &apos;re learning in school , and they &apos;re doing so on <unk> little action and people trying to explain what <unk> is .
and i got up on the other image in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition in <unk> with an exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s really quite young people , but the only thing that what it &apos;s all in the united states is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with that , and so you can also focus on the society with it , and to ask , okay , what do you want to join you , have your interest in doing that to engage you ?
so , <unk> , to hack now in biology , you need some material .
you need of natural materials , of course , and you need tools , and that &apos;s then a lab .
and what you &apos;re normally understood under a lab , that &apos;s as kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely , very , very , <unk> , trained academics with <unk> and so on .
and our approach was just to say , <unk> , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each of each <unk> has actually evolved higher technology than most of them , which is really like this .
and at the end of this premise , with this premise , the premise of this premise , i tried to try and try to see brian <unk> in england , and then took a <unk> , a <unk> , and , yes , it &apos;s kind of <unk> , and it works to work .
so every one that has been left with a soup of a soup that he has left too long .
i then tried this in my lab to try and expand a little bit , and then put it on ebay , and then made a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , which is just like <unk> <unk> , like this .
now that should be a joke now , but it &apos;s really not .
down here in the bottom of the picture , you see the lab , in <unk> , so this is such a <unk> garage with the same kind of <unk> garage , which has a group in paris , which has set up and really interesting things , and it &apos;s also pretty interesting to it , and it &apos;s also quite interesting to it , and it &apos;s also a very interesting thing .
and this is <unk> , which also mentioned <unk> , this one , such a kind of <unk> principle for molecular biology .
and yeah , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively relative to <unk> , so that &apos;s where there are people who do it alone , so much larger organizations , so much more <unk> in the form of the form , you know .
but always the approach that it &apos;s easy to stop and to be accessible .
the first project we did as an international group , when we &apos;re sort of aware of ourselves , <unk> , we have now here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that always chatting and chatting and so .
and then came from the <unk> <unk> website of the founder , and he said , <unk> , we &apos;ve got to really meet ourselves , and then meeting two functions , one in london , a little bit of a london , <unk> 10 , and soon in the <unk> , in san francisco .
and , in fact , it also went , <unk> , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what &apos;s our values and what are our economics , our foundation ?
and then we have a <unk> <unk> .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody just got the wishes , his and what &apos;s going to move it , expressed it .
there was , i think , a very good code .
and then we &apos;re not making it compulsory , but that &apos;s yes , i think it &apos;s quite good , and people are quite convinced of this .
and we actually tried to go back into the academic world , but there &apos;s somehow not there .
so i think that we are in the <unk> , even more step than the academic world .
well , what about projects are we actually doing so ?
a project that i &apos;ve done with the <unk> in switzerland was that we were going to have a so-called optical case or optical <unk> .
this is , if you focus a laser beam in a room , then you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and then you move in that focus , so it &apos;s captured there , so it &apos;s captured , like this kind of <unk> principle .
this really works , that &apos;s done in the academic <unk> , and we &apos;ve been thinking , <unk> , we might have , you know , have a webcam , <unk> the lens , you have a microscope , you know , you have a microscope , so you get a microscope .
you see that down there .
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> the laser <unk> and then trying to focus on that camera .
and that didn &apos;t work out , but we still have learned a lot .
so another project that came from the french group in paris , which worked out , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s like , in fact , such a kind of <unk> , so <unk> , or something like that , so he &apos;s engaged with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he was then built this this helmet , and in the cooperation with the museum , it &apos;s walked .
and then the visitors could go in the room , put on this chair , put that helmet up .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they were thinking , or how they were thinking , are the different lights in the room .
it was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which is to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying the genes that are able to reproduce , <unk> , fragments that you can make it visible .
so , if i do this , you know , the <unk> on the scene , go to collect some <unk> , and then they make this method , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this person , so .
and the machines that do something like that , they &apos;re quite expensive to buy commercial , the cheapest ones are going on at the same age of euros .
and that &apos;s not in <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application from many you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got these two <unk> <unk> , and i said , <unk> , that we make more simple and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got open source , <unk> available hardware , and now that &apos;s actually the cheapest <unk> of these devices , and now the cheapest supply of these devices are around .
i think it kind of six hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it becomes clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project that i started to do recently was to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yeah , like this kind of <unk> , it &apos;s about as far , two centimeters or something .
you invites <unk> to <unk> , and then they put them into these <unk> , and then i took them on <unk> , and then they put it up on the <unk> .
so the device that you see there is not working .
but this is so my prototype my prototype , which was quite <unk> , so on a branch of that branch , the thing on it , put electronics on it and the pressure was too high , and that was the pressure of it .
and then i took a <unk> and put it on this .
a <unk> , if you do it with water , has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s like 40 to <unk> bar about it .
and then you can then accelerate the particles strong enough , and then they go in the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros , or something like that , <unk> around the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
and so , in the moment , that &apos;s the <unk> of the scene , just to increase this availability of technology , and also to increase the information and the <unk> , that more people can engage in it .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have quite a little bit of it , and also not an opportunity to make it really well .
because , if you &apos;re reading about it , <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve seen it yourself or seen .
and i think technology becomes more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make meaningful people in society , you want to meet and join your mind , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> then <unk> the <unk> open and citizen science .
so that as citizens are capable of being able to be put through this scientific technology .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who officially put at least on the website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is also that you &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people in there than actually exist .
so i know by some people who don &apos;t .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
in part , with these <unk> , they put together in these places .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has only started it .
and <unk> , the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> , who are represented all over the world .
and what we hope is , of course , is that we &apos;re actually going to get into the same way , and then they &apos;re very well connected , so that even more people can be involved .
and i would invite everyone to look at this and try and try and try .
now , it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we actually make people work ?
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but also in the field of <unk> <unk> , and in front of all the things in the room .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;ve seen people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make them an equal experience of the experience .
now , i think the interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models , so cognitive models , which is paradigm that had been <unk> in our biological memory , and that we just have just been able to create again by interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that this <unk> , which you &apos;ve seen is that it &apos;s actually going to take you into the future , but in fact , the future is exactly at us , in our <unk> roots .
what are now <unk> models now ?
i took down four <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain to you briefly .
it &apos;s the models of cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have so well in the order of time .
we heard about these <unk> models that we have basically a natural relationship to virtuality .
and that sounds basically unusual .
and i &apos;m going to go back to that , and i &apos;m going to show you an attempt to try and have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve really been able to be able to talk very , very , very , very , very , really , to speak very , to speak very , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains itself from itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition are <unk> , which includes the denial of linearity , and what we say , of course , is that the linearity is as normal as we are today .
the fourth point is that the story is a place for us .
what is this now with the virtuality that is actually the most basic thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to show you that .
how many doors has the house you live in ?
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re not going to know at all immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go through in the spirit through this house , in <unk> , you live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it <unk> the reality , with no computer .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re trying to show the virtual reality of virtual reality , so we can do that all the time .
and this wealth of the virtual reality is to <unk> the reality that people have also needed the other time , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in that head , that memory was .
in this head , <unk> , and with these virtual images , the imagination , the imagination was being passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so powerful in us , that we can deal with the virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip here .
yes , this is .
the interesting thing about this is that at the time of the human time , and the medium was at the same time .
now , if you think a little bit more .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll talk about that again .
central tools of <unk> have been stories since history .
<unk> , priest , so-called <unk> , were <unk> off to preserve knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very strong to stories .
the author of the book of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , according to we still <unk> hours with stories of stories .
this means to a child who has spent the most of the time in the <unk> of his life with stories of stories .
now we think our love to stories is that we sat as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
this is a lot further back , in the cultures of the still times .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media as a particularly impressive is that we have <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
i &apos;ve brought you an example with the north american tribe of <unk> .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very <unk> area , and you &apos;ve had to navigate , from an island to get out of food .
and they &apos;ve done this with something called <unk> .
you may also know , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have any <unk> , but they &apos;ve been using it as <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped across songs .
which was the language <unk> of <unk> rang .
that means you &apos;re <unk> about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythm have the geology , which shows the topography of an area , and it also allows you to be able to put these songs and put together in the way to the left and on the left and then move back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing more to come from the top of a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening there ?
what happened is that &apos;s the <unk> machine age .
we &apos;ve been doing what &apos;s called the <unk> .
what happened is , it &apos;s the age machine , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories of external media .
on the book and the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of <unk> to <unk> .
virtuality is a little bit alien for us being alien , and has nothing to do with the reality .
bruce brown , a well-known <unk> at <unk> , is so far to say that this mass media , he says the book , and the picture , so not television , and so on , what we call mass media today , that this <unk> <unk> of our memories , and we have our ability to <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> machine machine .
what has influences our thinking and on our <unk> ?
and then the most powerful influences of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more <unk> over the course of the centuries and more <unk> by the influences of <unk> .
this is , instead of being individually , we have standardized , very common , common patterns of memories that we can hang out our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have an abstract <unk> language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing to do things more in pictures , not more in images , but we <unk> them .
we &apos;ve got used to that , that things happen .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity law , and there are only exceptions , like <unk> .
what &apos;s left is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re a lot of being arrested as a <unk> , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , and we had the age machine , and we &apos;re going to go through this so-called <unk> .
and that sounds very <unk> , and it sounds like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> , which bring us these possibilities back back to discover our skills .
it &apos;s about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to just explain this a little bit .
there are technological concepts like , for example , the augmented reality , which is the augmented reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , for example , then a concept of what the virtual world is doing with the real world is called the virtual world to the <unk> , which is virtual to feel virtual , which is going to respond again .
now , another example is called virtual reality .
so , of course , as crazy as that , of course , sounds in the context of my talk , that &apos;s where we &apos;re physically moving into <unk> , virtual worlds , all the way through the <unk> model .
and other example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a person .
all this needs the ability , our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated in degree , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and they &apos;re also here today .
so you might just get up for a little bit , so you can pause with the two over the project .
and this is a project that i brought as an example of how again on this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
which of course , of course , <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say to the computer game , you &apos;re very likely to see that any people are doing some people who do some <unk> or they play with some kind of <unk> in your hand .
anyway , they &apos;re doing it in there .
that &apos;s a game for outside .
and this is in sequence that i think i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , which we produce , with the real world .
i apologize to me that i need to be so <unk> .
so you can get much better , you know , there &apos;s a lot more than that .
and that &apos;s what i discover is that i discover a city by looking at what places was negative or negative .
and so i get a very different sight from the city , and that &apos;s a completely different impression that i see negative and positive zones of a city and get a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we &apos;d like to look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to sum up my talk , and that &apos;s in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a little bit of <unk> in the future , and that &apos;s actually a little bit of <unk> in the future , and that we actually have a little bit of <unk> , technological , new products , in fact , but it &apos;s actually going back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked if this bag was out there is a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to resolve the same thing in there .
but i &apos;m just going to do it again .
yes , kids are kind of curious about nature , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a <unk> of the house , so i &apos;m also looking at the issue of the curiosity , and how does the curiosity go back to our thinking , and why we &apos;re going to be curiosity again and that we need to <unk> , and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing with their own existence , as a creator .
when professors are curious about professors , they &apos;re a lot of people who are <unk> in this .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half a year .
a <unk> to the subject of natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are the whole and so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interacting and so on .
and that &apos;s where i just think one of these little devices up , because things are always more intuitive , more natural , <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to look at what &apos;s actually people , of course , what is <unk> or intuitively .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve been able to design in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation of human computers in the relationship of human computers , in the relationship of the human being , how our tools or how the computer is changing by the computer .
so i &apos;m busy with it , of course , when , of course , or intuitively .
you might have to look at it again .
why does that even happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a moment that we &apos;re moving here in a moment , and then we &apos;re moving from the fourth <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern in <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> of language .
that is , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve been talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , or in the same cave , and in other areas , cities form or villages , and it &apos;s sort of created the <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you also had to learn to learn , so not a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , of course .
and then that was then , by ancient society , and the first shape of abstraction .
and that was the one that was <unk> at the time , because , of course , the living language started to <unk> in the form of writing , which is what is <unk> and alive , i &apos;ll start and <unk> it in stone , and i &apos;m also <unk> it .
depending on how i &apos;m <unk> and when i &apos;m going on , it &apos;s of course a very different coverage , as if there &apos;s a way of living .
but then <unk> then moved that script as <unk> , got moved .
and then the next generation came in which we were actually primarily living .
this is the <unk> of pressure and <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at that time , it was just a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and others have said , are they really insane when the people are going to read , then the people will want to be , of course , totally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation , and the exciting thing , is that a <unk> is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really really in this <unk> phase that we &apos;re doing that .
so , of course , it completely confused us , because we see on the one side of the new media , social social media , facebook and facebook and so on .
and with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> <unk> , and no beef is more or other phenomena , which i just want to just <unk> and want to <unk> it .
and these two worlds just <unk> together , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing about this is , when you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , are highly aware of lots of mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but not more at the local level , it &apos;s on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not if i think of local <unk> , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that means that local village actually has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , as intuitive , but also the total transparency .
and as you knew at the time in the village , who &apos;s what you have with who and when , this is what happens to the <unk> of our self by the mobile <unk> of the self .
be that we know , we know , we know , we know , we know , and more and more and more and better .
as it used to happen in the village before .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been busy looking at what &apos;s like , because what it is for us , of course , is , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , what does the difference for us , but what does the difference ?
because a lot of people are getting people , they can &apos;t make it <unk> so they can handle it .
so you have to deal with it , which means that , and not just change it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and then , of course , something too intuitive , and how can i take a creator of it , and how much of the things that make the things that they &apos;re more intuitive , is that intuitive as intuitive , it &apos;s fun , and then they &apos;re just using it .
and you &apos;re also busy , as i believe , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s , of course , what you &apos;re going to start and look like that and that says , okay , now i just look inside the inside itself .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we do when we &apos;re going to <unk> ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of perception and how do we work that cognitive processing processing ?
because steve jobs once said , you <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something <unk> or intuitively , which means that that &apos;s at the core .
and you see , you know , you &apos;re a seven senses , most of us , most of us , are only going to be seven , you know , there &apos;s certainly seven , that &apos;s going to be the next , eighth sense , and as an extension , again .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of the use of the word , knowledge , don &apos;t know what it looks like .
but i have to understand at the core , in the nature , when gets information to information , when gets information to information , from information , knowledge , to know how i know things as intuitive as i can , or of course , can make it <unk> .
and of course , how does design influence on perception .
we see this , when i do things , then i can make them confusing , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know , what is salt and pepper , or , i can make it sort of intuitively , to show things .
so much more natural , in a gourd , but i look directly , where is salt and pepper .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to be thinking about the right one , where is what &apos;s inside .
and then they just intuitive access to the left , and then i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in there , giving up salt .
but also our perception also , how does it make us feel .
for example , that perception in the context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and yet our perception is changing by what context we &apos;re doing .
does anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s been more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s an n .
a second bubble is starting to relate or associate things .
and then , if i take a look at it again , we &apos;re not only looking at one of the unity , which is a circle and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , another one .
this is what you call <unk> , or <unk> , which also affects us in perception .
the importance for the designers that have the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> nearby , <unk> of the continuity and so forth .
so often in the third , you &apos;ve forgotten .
but this is essential to be part of , if you just want to make things so intuitive things so intuitive .
so the next phenomenon , which is very interesting to see this .
and it sounds very banal first , but it &apos;s interesting to be interesting when you get closer .
so we have the front of the eyes , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the back of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re looking at one from the back of the back .
because it &apos;s a assumption that you can see what you can see , <unk> circle .
that is , we &apos;re just <unk> our vision before we see it back back in the back of our <unk> , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got a cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what <unk> you want .
so that &apos;s then , again , that comes back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back of the sun doesn &apos;t go and say , well , look at it now , i &apos;m going to look at what you see , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so , a whole , very <unk> process , like certain things and what are happening to these things .
i don &apos;t know how to know that image .
that &apos;s exactly what i just described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees it .
does anybody see a thing ?
a <unk> , right .
if i &apos;ve seen that , that there &apos;s a <unk> inside , you know that .
you &apos;re never going to forget it , because i &apos;m showing you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , see it always .
so , i didn &apos;t tell you now , you know , you don &apos;t know any patterns , but i have it within a very short time of time to see this dog in the <unk> picture .
and that &apos;s this projection of vision , <unk> , see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to turn forward to the front i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , quite exciting processes , which then , in this , yeah , gray , they &apos;re not really , but here in this <unk> mass just that &apos;s going on .
anybody know what three seconds is ?
for long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know a little bit about three seconds , until i sort of like to go out of the present , i can also bridge very well , and i can bridge it very well in which i &apos;ve always been involved in three seconds .
it has to process it as a present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegantly <unk> for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
also , a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
so , you know , you know , if you know that , pay attention to who you like for a long time , because i don &apos;t take <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions that we have .
that means that this first idea is happening in a rapid speed , as we perceive things .
and as we look at things also , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we protect ourselves against our environment , so that we can think of that way .
and of course , the creator , of course , is not only related to the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but of course , of course , with the subject of <unk> .
so , like a human being , a human being is about .
so , there &apos;s something that is practical , which is so <unk> of things or <unk> things .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but it &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is somebody in such a little <unk> , which is not a little bit like <unk> money in terms of money , even though it wasn &apos;t so practical ?
and we &apos;re more likely to be on the <unk> , on the <unk> that we also think of , of course .
back to my actual subject of natural user interface and the topic , which is , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> always means , how can i get to a certain goal , or how can a user is able to reach the user in a certain sense , efficient and <unk> .
so it &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i make a little bit like <unk> ?
can i be able to use that directly or i need an n or i need an n or i need to be involved .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i &apos;m doing it differently , and it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand that .
and then if you were part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , look at this , then you can also understand why <unk> percent of our today &apos;s software is little intuitively , or not based on <unk> , which is already much more intuitive in many areas or <unk> , although it &apos;s already more intuitive than classical software .
and also , intuitive <unk> is not only for apple to make a fundamental <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , if i just want to make technology to harness people .
why ?
because , in fact , through this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user <unk> , then , for example , there are five times faster on the average of our target .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classical <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , it &apos;s only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that they probably have to go home four hours of home , but your employers or anybody is going to see them with four hours accordingly .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s a really important thing for us , of course , to make certain things .
and then , if we &apos;re going to go into the field of software , this is the first <unk> of <unk> interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that came out now with a <unk> neural model or mental model like the software <unk> , they &apos;ve been working , you know , the metaphor of a desktop to make the metaphor of a desktop , to harness the computer .
so not more zeros and ones or a metaphor or a metaphor or a metaphor .
it made it a lot of <unk> , but it also goes much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works a lot more with behavior .
so i &apos;m doing this as a <unk> , a lot more , more often , more often than this .
this is also a paradigm shift .
i mean , that &apos;s what i always look like for success , just the <unk> is a app .
and then , if i take one step into these natural user interfaces , where i have a voice , by language , by <unk> , is by gesture , and no more by mouse and <unk> things have to control things , then i &apos;m still faster and faster .
but that leads me to the point , when will things become more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here and see , what does this mean from the view of the <unk> , when is it really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s a little bit intuitive for us people , if i have to think very little about it .
so it seems like he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s just like that .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
so , if we look at that , if we look at existing <unk> of one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can use it as a <unk> .
that means i can transfer such an intuitive , human <unk> to a software , and then make the software a lot more <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of us , and now i have <unk> .
this is called the <unk> .
that &apos;s what each of us is using and <unk> is an acronym and it stands for orient , <unk> , inform , <unk> .
that &apos;s all of you all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it sort of intuitively , or partly instinctively .
the model is already going to be <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in the world in young and old , and it &apos;s used for us all the time , without that most of us knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> times from us , so in sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s less often <unk> than a day .
now , i can now orient this mental health game , <unk> , informed , <unk> , <unk> on a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , it &apos;s similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> than this is the classic metaphor of the classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i put this up now , for example , in which i &apos;m watching you as a <unk> , <unk> as a choice , inform me , and i can look at it in detail , and i can see it in detail , and i can send it to someone in detail , and you can buy a shopping and so on .
then i can transfer this whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
i just ate pies .
and in fact , i interact with the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview , can now filter this , and i can say , just show me all of chocolate for example .
and once again , one interface , which is essential and much more natural .
because , because i can grab things like this piece , <unk> , and you can come to me , is much more natural than if you have organized the web pages or other mechanisms or other mechanisms that can make it available .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i want to close and to give a hint , also , designers have to think differently , to come in to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
first , if you &apos;re going to be big as a kid , as a child , is that you &apos;re taking care of what <unk> you have , right ? and depending on whether their parents have allowed them to play more or less , the more , so your curiosity will work in .
and the curiosity won &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why everyone who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m doing it now , basically all of these <unk> , <unk> , 40 years <unk> , in the quality .
and there &apos;s a central dot there .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
and every day you can go and give it a <unk> order for about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glide as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we actually don &apos;t take phosphorus and give it forward .
and amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re doing something here with something that &apos;s actually a <unk> , but not that way .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years , and already now , through the <unk> world of the world , has been <unk> much of uranium into the environment than in all <unk> .
in the last 20 20 years alone , <unk> tons of uranium in our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it &apos;s <unk> leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how if i would say , <unk> your child , blow it five times three times .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about this from <unk> to <unk> , our entire earth is used to , or later , a <unk> .
that &apos;s about thinking about the <unk> to <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first thing .
in the ground , there &apos;s <unk> percent in the ground .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and lose between 11 pounds of 30 tons of 30 tons of 30 tons of <unk> , or in the square meter .
that means we lose the ground about five thousand times more than new .
so , of course , we can look at the <unk> .
and it &apos;s all packaging .
in <unk> , for example , at the <unk> 20 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and because we get older , they &apos;re getting bigger .
this is , in a way , they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
one baby takes about six thousand <unk> <unk> .
we could , of course , to reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this will be balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we do with this <unk> ?
here &apos;s a proof of that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted by the solid <unk> <unk> .
people are about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is <unk> , right ?
traditionally , we think in <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you go to the people who exist when you say that it would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing to stabilize the human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re living a human , you &apos;ll get the earth .
here it says , the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than us .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no , no termites , in that far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they &apos;re physically working a lot harder than we do , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , you &apos;re in your weight , there &apos;s 30 billion people in your energy energy .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re gone from , what we really wanted to reach and could do , and how sad we are , we can see that in the earth , you can see that , for example , a program , by 20 40 , would you want to be <unk> , right ?
you can only be <unk> if they don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one one ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be dumber than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
thankfully not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
there &apos;s still six hundred billion trees alone .
you know , did you hear something about <unk> trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than trees .
and where you see , even something like demeter , which <unk> <unk> is that allows our own <unk> .
we lose three million tons of phosphorus every year , which really would have to go back in loops .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that means we feel such guilty of us on earth , that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , like you &apos;re all saying that our own <unk> will go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to make sense of being less harmful , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a great footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , the highest , not being there ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you were shooting away , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we make brazil in brazil , where we get the nutrients back .
in fact , we can put nutrients from that way in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , where we take the waste of it .
in china , one of the things that &apos;s called a <unk> today , you know , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to stupid our nutrients .
that means that all the western <unk> is drawing out that the city has always taken , but the farmers never had returned .
and so the cities had to grow more , because the farmers went to the cities , and the cities had to keep going to get their nutrients .
all of all the western empires are expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get rid of nutrients .
even today , if you were invited to dinner in china , you expect to stay out of the food that they &apos;re going to stay up until you see the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat them , not to <unk> .
that means you can see the internet , how to get the nutrients back .
this is actually beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture makes a biogas , on the favelas of five thousand people in favelas , so that a farmer can make about <unk> dollars , and they &apos;re waiting for a farmer to do about <unk> dollars and ducks and vegetables and vegetables .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the favelas is back over ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people &apos;s control , that we have a little bit bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , <unk> , but the plants are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to design by design , which a farmer can just grow .
that &apos;s called the <unk> .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities has ever been <unk> .
they could just ruin a liter of <unk> <unk> , and then the plant would be ruined about years .
you don &apos;t find .
that is , we don &apos;t have to control people &apos;s control , that we have a little bit bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what they want to do is write out in germany , in germany , it &apos;s the best <unk> of all the treatment treatment is in <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can get a little bit of it .
because the <unk> plant could best get phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it doesn &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve been using it over three years .
the dutch government explains , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , what phosphorus is .
but we need all of the total .
you can understand , there are two countries control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s worldwide .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of <unk> control .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace is to replace by other energy .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
this is not about making the existing one slightly less bad things , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask , what the right thing is .
it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , it &apos;s easier , of course , because in holland the country &apos;s built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you &apos;ve got them <unk> , and they come to fifty roses .
very inefficient .
but quite effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eats about six <unk> three pounds during their lives .
there .
this is not scientifically exactly right , because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> will be .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very effective , yes ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s why not about resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not to burn up a little bit better and burn it up and <unk> all the materials in the way all the materials , but to ask questions , how do you connect loops ?
imagine mozart is efficient .
yes ?
if i went to dinner for the dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , <unk> ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you &apos;re in love with someone , efficient ?
yes ?
that is , everything that counts in life is not to save it .
all <unk> .
we say the people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have a green green .
no , it &apos;s just throwing it right , right ?
in every place , where you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re going to get <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things up , you have a <unk> .
we &apos;re thinking from the north .
there &apos;s every footprint that &apos;s <unk> .
when they walk , yes , every footprint of every footprint the ground .
because the soil is , because the mosses are going to die , and the wind is washing down the ground .
but if you are in italy , every footprint that &apos;s going to be footprint , that the water remains longer .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint , which is a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , what about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just <unk> .
so not saving , prevent .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , a coke can kick out of the car .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , which is an temperature at room temperature .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
they &apos;re building everywhere in two hours .
and they contain seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two loops .
not all should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , you just use them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , they have to go to biological systems .
the things that are going to be used , go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
all right commercials , not for the company <unk> per se , but that you now help this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do the things that we do .
yes ?
so , if i go to the food and say that it &apos;s free of <unk> , then you don &apos;t really help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck with what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
no toxic in there .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can do with the <unk> at the <unk> , and you can go <unk> into biological loops , right ?
all of it is <unk> of it .
and if we can do that , of course , we can , of course , for <unk> , to nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the <unk> worldwide that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you help , ask people to ask .
hey , <unk> , makes you really serious ?
because now they &apos;ve changed twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not so sure if you &apos;re really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what has just been shown right now .
.
we can now make things like that , if you zoom in , if you zoom in , you can make them in biological loops .
the technical cycles are in the same .
there &apos;s a direct thing to do this .
this is the first ecological backpack , in fact , which is made in the circulation .
so , in any store , you can <unk> things .
if you come to this , yes ?
do you remember that <unk> ?
when right now is the waste .
all the <unk> <unk> is almost almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside that you can just go back to <unk> , then you can go back to the baby in israel or tunisia in tunisia .
yes ?
if you take those of these <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , &quot; and it would take the powder to plant trees .
that &apos;s the baby <unk> for the whole life , from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent all again .
i created an institute .
now , a lot of people are working with , and you can all get involved .
there &apos;s extra group of it , <unk> , where everyone can join .
so no longer saving , prevent , avoiding , reduce , no <unk> , it &apos;s intelligent waste .
do you make it curious ?
thank you .
work &apos;s work .
music as language .
in the description to my talk , it says that i was <unk> , i think , as a <unk> , so i understand in the english <unk> .
<unk> are the translator of the written notes in <unk> music .
so as a translator , as a translator , not just word for the word of text into a different language , but also to understand the deeper sense of the words and <unk> to make it a useful translation , everyone who has to do with <unk> .
in fact , to translate in english , you can take more knowledge because when it was about poetry or it &apos;s about poetry or even about poetry .
it &apos;s kind of alien , but for <unk> , what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i just started the written notes .
you &apos;re sure that the composer has all <unk> in notes , which he imagined .
in fact , the grades are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about the same or <unk> , like a verbal verbal , as well as <unk> accurate , the description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not smell , the level of <unk> is just to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , not feeling .
that means the role of the interpreter has to look at these <unk> figures in another one , which is <unk> concrete , nonverbals .
today , i want to tell you what else i will translate , so <unk> , to translate even into a verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do this in german , because if i had to translate it again in english , it would be equivalent to the translation of the translation of the translation .
so that &apos;s the way that music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes are the function of the letters of a typeface .
so it &apos;s not going to do only to read just grades and push that keys on the piano or the right place on a <unk> .
because that would only be the letters you learned to paint .
the point of the letters is , you know , if you can do the language .
so you need to take the learning process of music for at least as much as long as the spoken language .
and then there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you &apos;re learning it for the <unk> , just passive , or you can also talk active , to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts like a <unk> .
now , after you first have chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to turn out of the evolution of the evolution of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether there &apos;s words , thoughts by composers themselves .
you study the works that he formed before and after .
you offer comparison .
the <unk> to write it .
how do he mean ?
how were the circumstances of the society and the politics ?
all of that interest me .
you think in this time , just reading contemporary images , or in literature .
but in the time , you also have a rich knowledge for the composers who are playing more often more often , and it &apos;s getting easier to feel in it , and feel it .
the composer is always getting more to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece , is getting more and more to my personal cause to play .
now , since the notes of all other as an accurate record of the cause of composers , it &apos;s a framework , it &apos;s turning , turn this framework to make it happen again with meaning and meaning to it .
i say to my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> , which could have these sounds .
now for me , and for the composers of that , and what they might mean now for him today .
every note , every phrase , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it myself , because it comes out of my own personal <unk> .
it has to be in here and now , you know , i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve made so long in advance , like <unk> .
how you experienced a happy new day again , even though , with the same rituals of life , stand up , their breakfast , go to work , as well as i can go to the new piece .
and i got back a day older , coming seasons , my pulse goes slower at night , in a <unk> , it takes a longer longer to come back at home than at home .
i &apos;m going to take a breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
all of that impacts me and all of that also affect my experience with composition .
it &apos;s a wonderful thing when i stand on stage with a <unk> on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and it &apos;s going to answer that answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have to have , and what you can &apos;t have samples like that .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and when you have the audience , you experience how the music communicates alive .
so , every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like this , like this moment .
i can &apos;t play this way in 20 years today .
i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> of <unk> , emotions and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> , and i &apos;ll have a new <unk> .
i have a nice concrete example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> with my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a known <unk> , <unk> and long professor of the <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was much too young , so that he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky , it was very early at age 13 , and i was in high school in my school .
i was at the time 17 , when i was in one of his class , and i was playing the last thing that was four of the chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
that &apos;s such a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he <unk> and said , so ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was even 60 .
well , at 17 , you just have dreams , but there &apos;s no major memories .
i &apos;ll play this piece over every few years , and it always has changed for me , even though it &apos;s not changed .
so , it &apos;s exciting every time , because again i read something new .
one example of it from a very different area . monet &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s too different <unk> , with <unk> light .
he &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , just as she looked at him .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable to this .
and by now , i &apos;ve been older than the chopin was <unk> , when he wrote the piece .
he was only lived for <unk> years .
and i think it &apos;s important to look back into the notes , even though i &apos;m doing it .
to keep <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he has died .
well , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to do about the same way for the spoken language .
often , the <unk> is so that you just learn the notes read .
you basically learn to read this before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes in the instrument .
and then , if all the fingers of time and just kind of like the way it gets in the notes , then they come out of sounds that sound like music .
when that &apos;s all the point , the students get this <unk> piece .
it &apos;s hardly spoken in the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s a quick <unk> on the front , that &apos;s a fast piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc . .
that &apos;s most of the ones here .
but even though you <unk> that data , there &apos;s still something technical .
and it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget about a lot of <unk> .
which is that , to make music on the instrument that your own musical and feel should be there before .
which is that singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn the singing , because the parents don &apos;t have <unk> , it &apos;s not going to do it from themselves .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experiences and the idea of music , and then it &apos;s about another possibility , so we &apos;re going to sound about an instrument .
people who have never been singing , have never felt immediately with your body , how it is to form a sound .
<unk> a phrase with its own breath .
because the instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
these are the <unk> of the piano in the piano to my fingers .
the tune comes out of the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
<unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make music anymore when it gets bored .
no longer needed to whistle or sing .
every single music is going to be <unk> , if you &apos;re constantly <unk> with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yeah , but what do you do if i couldn &apos;t sing ?
i ask that , you can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both , it &apos;s not too late to start to find out if you can &apos;t yet , or learn how to put these little muscles who are using the vocal chords , they use it properly .
we can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve <unk> it to you that they &apos;re <unk> .
i wonder how <unk> competent was this diagnosis ?
do you have a <unk> or <unk> , how to say that today ?
or d , they don &apos;t like music , and they want to do that for free .
but what i &apos;d like to do is that music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , you can see , in all cases , nobody has to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say i don &apos;t understand , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i reply , but you can &apos;t tell you if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says it &apos;s somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can do it , because i can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t get rid of the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to give up classical music , because they don &apos;t play instrument .
listen to it , and tell them whether it tastes to them or not .
whether it &apos;s too sweet or sweet .
tell them what they feel .
and at the time , they also get claims and want to taste a little bit of spices there , or taste some kind of fine differences .
now , why do i challenge my audience , that it &apos;s also <unk> ?
because the music is a language and a language to communicate .
a piece of art that you &apos;re never looking at has not to work .
the food that &apos;s been cooked or a chef as a chef or a chef as a chef , has to be eaten , and not just looked at recipes .
so , please hear when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if you &apos;re in an environment , where the adults are active music , or at least active music , a child grows up , then it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> , asking what color has your flower ?
so can you can play me in blue now ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of a red flower now .
and this sounds very different than before .
and that was the first beginning of the very beginning of musical expression .
so the first step into one interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of this , this is a hundred , <unk> or even three hundred years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments are <unk> .
there was <unk> <unk> , as an instrument , not at all .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the bach would have been excited if he had the <unk> possibilities of modern <unk> .
i can see the <unk> that bach has had , in the modern wing , to sound what a <unk> <unk> can &apos;t .
and i know beethoven , you know , he heard more than he had become deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is an orchestra from then being rejected by the time .
that &apos;s why the composers depend on us to reinvent the pieces .
so they become audible in the spirit that they &apos;ve imagined .
and also what you would think in in the spirit today .
or what i &apos;m talking about today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
were you jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
so when i come to , with my little <unk> w <unk> and i &apos;m going to get me off , this feeling is coming .
i &apos;ll shoot something through the head .
i say , <unk> , why do you need a big car ?
that &apos;s a half of its value in the first year .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have a little car to do that ?
and then i immediately falls , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward sense .
our organism has invented a great way to bring like that awkward feelings like envy to disappear .
you can also try it in words like revenge , or <unk> or something like that .
so i want to explain to you today something about this mechanism or something that you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism comes from a lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie in a lie , as you may have heard , when people say , nobody has a wall to build a wall .
and then they <unk> rocks so he &apos;ll give you the point of view .
you can see a lie in a lie like that , that liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s very easy to check that it &apos;s very different in mind .
he only makes them just make them and not yourself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , who has to do it yourself .
you need this lie to get a <unk> to get a <unk> .
they can get them less , yes , <unk> or also .
they need time .
from that time , one anecdote you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once has a woman .
and this woman was <unk> , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her at all .
picasso says , just wait .
it will always be more similar .
at this point and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn something that artists can be very good about .
because artists have a <unk> relationship with a lie .
the artist tells you something with , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if you just look into the mirror .
the artist is sharing with them in a portrait of something that you &apos;re familiar with when you &apos;re looking at this piece of art .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it may not be similar to you , and it &apos;s always going to be similar .
so here you have this mechanism that we can use a lie in a lie , a great invention for the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not just in art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , again , again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility about this true input , the mirror can &apos;t lie from that true input .
but we should just be familiar with that you can &apos;t tell a woman , you can &apos;t say that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
so here it is necessary , what we understand under <unk> <unk> , again .
we need this <unk> , and we need this <unk> , which is that we can &apos;t still live again .
we don &apos;t only have in art , in <unk> , but also in science such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife of <unk> .
they heard about the book of charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
that the human man should be <unk> , and yes , there would be a common ancestors between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and she said that that &apos;s not true what charles writes about .
human beings should have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge .
why do we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without that <unk> .
because we &apos;re <unk> at this self-deception , that feeling great , descent of the highest creatures , not from one such <unk> , something like an organism like an organism that exists still in a stone , which is what it is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we need to prevent people all the ways of doing things , especially when they &apos;re true .
and so you can see how slowly this mechanism turns out , and how the traces look that it &apos;s going to take on something different than this great image of ourselves , i want to show you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told them about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to be particularly like this because he has a propensity for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m on the fire department .
and because i &apos;m on the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re on this place . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral sense , because it &apos;s used , we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
do that , and then you know the sentence .
even though i &apos;m on the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind us .
that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> that &apos;s not interested in <unk> .
that &apos;s the interest for <unk> .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can look at where we can learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best thing , the fire fire .
and he signed up .
and <unk> , you also don &apos;t say his teacher , you &apos;d like to put fires somewhere and enjoy when the fire was after .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re in charge of taking the dangers , the others only do , when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and this one of the <unk> is that , in the heart of the <unk> , the <unk> already knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say it loud .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious conscious mind that immediately <unk> , without doing something about it , and the things that you know is very different , and the things that you know is a lot better for them and others .
and so , you know , just like these words that we &apos;re doing in the language of the politically , we &apos;re always using it .
actually , we know something else is the case .
but we know when we say that , the social story is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that should work .
so i want to share with you what we found in my institute .
according to what logic is that deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than that we already know in the unconscious , that it &apos;s valid from the outside .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is going ahead , which many of you know and some of you , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so a <unk> , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not about stop <unk> , physical nature .
and if you have people in front of you who have a stable belief that they own a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been given out of the soul , they think that it &apos;s like the soul of the soul , it &apos;s like that , in a way , an intellectual framework about them , not from matter , and it &apos;s like the soul , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and now , think of that soul , you know , that it &apos;s kind of in this natural nature , in this natural nature , <unk> , it &apos;s called the latin to the latin , present .
and so if this <unk> then <unk> over the people , then he &apos;s filled with it with spirit , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so she should come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something that &apos;s supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have that assumption in front of you , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky to do with a <unk> in a lie .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
you know about the school .
this is now a <unk> that describes a logic .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
because to lie , you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this process , three sentences come from .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> &apos;s right , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
so , i saw him in particular .
and the third set , which immediately shows up with people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say , who doesn &apos;t have a soul , who is dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic of this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , these are logical .
that i can argue everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell the reality of reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critically , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , it &apos;s got no soul .
these things are logical .
and now our consciousness is feeling right now , that &apos;s what you can do .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the opposite of the first sentence is already proven , and assuming the opposite .
because in fact , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which it &apos;s easy to do is that two sentences correct , and a third <unk> that looks like it &apos;s going to look like it would have something to do with that , we can save our <unk> .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can continue these things about different examples .
in the present , for example , we have a very modern example , and that &apos;s always filling up .
this is what you have to do with this another <unk> topic , a <unk> from philosophy to present .
so this has to do with that we go back to the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who was named johannes <unk> , and after this is called <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> based on pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you put that exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , it <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack is to go first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
this is what the <unk> is introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> are solving each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you get another example , so if you &apos;re going to get a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason and nothing to do it .
automatically , he &apos;s going to the right thought .
so if you have this idea , you &apos;re being driven in nature , you know , the bigger pile that you put in a immediately , and they also quickly have the feeling that there must be a free will .
and if we &apos;re already in <unk> , you know , in <unk> , i remember in brain science .
there &apos;s a <unk> scholars , which is called the wolf <unk> , and by saying , you know , wolf <unk> says there is no <unk> .
now , again , we can form the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf <unk> right , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
these sentences are completely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper in this third sentence .
and this looks something like that , who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , can &apos;t be moved to responsibility and claims to responsibility , and it &apos;s so <unk> .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , you would have to show you if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so much as if the first sentence is wrong by the first sentence , as if you take the opposite , the opposite .
and now you can just do , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , the courage to practice a lie .
so , for example , for example , if you meet a person you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;re going to get one of the things that there are <unk> , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you have a problem .
because as they &apos;re busy doing it , to make sure you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he fooled it .
because he led them to a <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> themselves .
because actually this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in the <unk> of the need to prove that there are <unk> .
so , in the kind of shift in <unk> , you &apos;re experiencing the brilliance of a lie .
and once again , if you have an opportunity to do that in other people , they do it , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make them happy if they don &apos;t remember the way they &apos;re doing it .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;ve been allowed to ask myself if i can mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here and asked me if i wanted to hold a talk here and give my idea .
i &apos;ve got to be honest , you &apos;ve got it <unk> , and it was hard to talk to me at the beginning of my idea .
and i may be thinking , maybe i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but , of course , the sum is all , many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the two nice girls , the two nice girls , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that has been made for this bad image of the image , because i &apos;ve already started studying engineering engineering , engineering school today , and today , i think , you know .
and then , in the middle of berlin , it &apos;s <unk> to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t have it in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> at the time , the <unk> called <unk> .
they &apos;re called <unk> today .
because a good engineer has a good engineer built or <unk> .
but kind of <unk> like &apos; n <unk> , from which it comes out of a hundred watts of the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;m grateful to the fact that he &apos;s got the word back again again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because all the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> years .
there was the fact that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you thought evil .
but the place of <unk> , but it was called wind and solar power , and i started in the middle of the 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been told today was , because many , many beautiful expressions were that i was living through .
i &apos;ve worked in the collective of the collective , which was <unk> .
we were twenty people .
if one said no , it was the <unk> , which has been a completely <unk> , and i &apos;ve got a lot of years to do that , whether i really might have been a great piece of thinking about , if i really had all of my father &apos;s colleagues on him , because all of my father &apos;s colleagues have been <unk> with your child .
there &apos;s insanity .
and that was really , very , very , very , very <unk> , and you also come into that , in such a phase , just put up a picture in <unk> , where i &apos;ve been asked to be 10 years ago , <unk> , <unk> , of course , <unk> , <unk> , of course , whether that &apos;s really the great thing .
and i got it up to <unk> , and then we &apos;ve gotten to friends in the company , i &apos;ve become <unk> of the company , which then was one of the largest <unk> in the world .
and so , of course , a <unk> , but then we have the problem of a growing company , and then we have <unk> , a small group , decided that we &apos;ll start back and go back and go back to the next theme of the future , and that &apos;s what i think is the next theme of the future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s not that we talk about it .
and i &apos;ve got a project that i &apos;ve got to introduce you now .
and the title of my talk was , you know , a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to start with a relatively more <unk> story , where could you be able to make sense of memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have 30 percent today today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s just not technological .
if you &apos;re more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
i always tell you that the politicians , if they &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
they always say why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , figures that was <unk> , have started the first contacts of the island , just calculate .
as big as big , it &apos;s actually a battery , so that you have an island to 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go ahead again .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
by the way , a hundred <unk> <unk> are about a hundred <unk> electric performance on the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear power nuclear power power , because it &apos;s really fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , that &apos;s going to be deleted with petrol , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that goes fast .
you make such a box .
and then it looks like this .
they &apos;re always waiting three of the <unk> , two will always waited .
yeah , this is what you see there is the burden down .
we also have very detailed data too .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is the rule of a <unk> system or a system that can only be <unk> in small amounts .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the diesel will <unk> and the wind , the sun <unk> the load so they can map the larger portion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy a year , not the performance at the moment , they have to switch off the diesel .
that means , in the moment , you have to make sure that renewables can be able to take over the web .
and of course , you can only , of course , if you &apos;re building staff in some way .
that has no one on the world .
that &apos;s a little style , so you can also use your <unk> on a little bit of <unk> .
people are always asking me , what do they do , in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what it is .
but if you want to <unk> some of these <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to build a grid , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 to ninety percent renewable , and then there &apos;s the rest here , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work that it &apos;s going to work with batteries .
that will be an energy energy that will be hydrogen , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or <unk> , that will be it .
they &apos;re going to be more like to go to a <unk> and not <unk> and <unk> .
we just wanted to know , what &apos;s a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far do you even get there ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
and they have wind and the sun and the <unk> , and they came to the result , a very interesting outcome , that you took a lot of a very interesting outcome that , after 20 years a <unk> requires to 50 cents per <unk> , about 50 cents per <unk> .
this was the first computation six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper to do that , if the five percent five percent per year goes up .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what would it have to be done ?
have negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we were only at the time only five people to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a brain system , because we &apos;re still 20 percent of diesel , and it &apos;s also not <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> on the island , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing great .
also , we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we have decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of move the electrical through the island of the island to three .
so , we &apos;ve been looking for first to find the greatest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in which trap japan .
and <unk> is in the early &apos; 70s at the &apos; 70s , <unk> , and then had been developed , and then we got <unk> to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it &apos;s got a megawatts of performance , and it can bring for six hours of that performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of have <unk> .
and then put it out .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he says there , put in the hall in the hall to actually see the entire dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall , it &apos;s going to look like this , which is the big battery , here &apos;s the entire battery , which we &apos;re here with the net .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to sort of represent the <unk> on the web .
and you can see here again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
this is what we see here again again , again , again , all of the diesel here again , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since <unk> was that in the hall , it &apos;s sort of <unk> , so far , it &apos;s sort of <unk> , which is in between the individual system of electronics in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the subject of battery and the subject in between .
you have to be able to communicate the battery , of course , you can communicate the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is to the topic that you &apos;re basically on this island today , all of the things that we &apos;re going to get is that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , what &apos;s going to do right now and <unk> , <unk> , how to go on the island , for example , in the island for <unk> to 30 percent , we <unk> the wind and the sun .
and then <unk> is then <unk> .
so <unk> , <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate on the island , so we can start integrating <unk> , you can do the burden .
that is , if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through the n , you can <unk> by <unk> , you can do that , you should be doing , you know , the percentage of <unk> , but you will never be able to give on memory .
and that &apos;s a little bit of the message .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the diesel , then you don &apos;t have the <unk> mass that causes a certain kind of inertia of the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just rotating <unk> masses of large <unk> , where the wave around the wave is like all around europe .
we look in this web , the 50 hertz see , and when it &apos;s <unk> <unk> nine hertz , we start a few <unk> <unk> , then again , a little <unk> steam , then we come back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you cut it somewhere , it takes a while .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time , they can respond to other other .
if you don &apos;t have that , that spinning mass , then you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> two milliseconds on this big battery two milliseconds .
and then you can see , there &apos;s a huge amount of neurons there .
and the message is now , we need to take this rotating masses , if we kind of like our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to achieve that at all .
and then we have to break our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is easy to keep the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> right now , <unk> from <unk> , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not going .
and what we &apos;re just trying to do is to just try to do it , that you can break down the capacity , the <unk> capacity , by bringing electrochemical memory into the net .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
and to that point , people come and look at our <unk> , sort of our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get a piece of the future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had over the last 30 years .
not , there &apos;s there , there &apos;s insanity , <unk> , we &apos;ve never come up with it .
we have <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go from that for the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of <unk> and the same capacity .
very simple , it will come .
there will be a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i just have experienced in the last two years , that the scientists are looking at my side .
we have now got over 10 million <unk> , too , <unk> now to the german net now .
that &apos;s going to take place in april .
so from that , you know , there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s just a change that &apos;s going on to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is right .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far in discussions , they &apos;ve always been trying to do , these <unk> , they &apos;re doing a little bit of their own web , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
and the question is very simple , if they &apos;re totally independent from any fossil or <unk> <unk> that are going to be <unk> anywhere in the world , and you &apos;re going to get an island to them , you &apos;re an island .
and then you just use that , which is in the sun and wind there , where they live .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of an <unk> energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful for you to use the solar power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and in the same way , the lecture of <unk> <unk> is that you can be a collective , and use solar energy , a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to just encourage you , in the sense that you can still be a little bit mad and can have a vision .
and you really have to remain quite <unk> , but i think it goes .
thank you .
when steve lopez , new angeles times , who went through the streets of los angeles one day , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless who played on a violin , just two strings .
many of you will know the story , because of <unk> articles on this , later , a book , which was <unk> , with robert <unk> and jamie <unk> as a nathaniel anthony <unk> , who was <unk> anthony <unk> , who was a very promising career and a very promising career by studying anthony anthony early early on his previous career .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a <unk> , and 30 years later he lived on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i encourage you to read <unk> book or to look at the movie , so that you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that was born between these two men , but how the music was allowed to get this connection , but how it was allowed to get this instrument to get nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney hall hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very <unk> , and he <unk> sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and hillary in the dodgers , the dodgers could never create in the baseball world <unk> , and all of this because of the <unk> passage of beethoven fourth symphony .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email that said that nathaniel was interested in <unk> to me .
i still have to mention that nathaniel got a medical treatment , because he was already using electrical electrical and handcuffed to a trauma that followed his entire life .
and as a result , he &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenic stages . they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he goes away for days , in the streets of <unk> row , always in the streets of <unk> row , and put on the <unk> of his own mind .
and in the same way , nathaniel was around , as we started with our first lecture at walt disney hall hall . he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and was completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how somebody wanted to poison in the sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid i could lose him , that he could sink in one of his states , and that i started to destroy his relationship to the violin , when i started to talk about scale and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first set of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i was playing , i realized that in <unk> &apos;s eyes , there was a total change .
it was like being under the impact of a invisible medicine , a chemical reaction whose catalyst was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle he took his violin , and began to play a few clips from <unk> to play , and then asked me to end up playing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , started from bach to beethoven , didn &apos;t know , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he had not only had a <unk> knowledge of music , but it also had a tight personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;d ever know about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
and he was talking to music and talked about music was from this <unk> , confused man who had moved to los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , fine , in juilliard trained musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to think of it , his thoughts and delusions of his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> conditions .
i understood that exactly the nature of art .
and this is why we &apos;re doing music , so we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s deep inside of all of us , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity lens , to reality .
and the reality of that expression is coming up all of us , and it moves , and the united states .
what would bring him back , so he brought it back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought it back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and recognized his talent and <unk> it .
and i &apos;m going to go back again with nathaniel music , whether or <unk> from walt disney hall or <unk> row , because he reminds me why i was a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen <unk> the <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i used a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first thing was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he became the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could think of it to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the ceo of the company was asked , and asked if i could give you a little bit about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this incredible problem for our chefs have become , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we found the oceans as we <unk> forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , they have collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s going to be <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of <unk> are necessary to get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
not taste very well .
so here &apos;s finally a company , trying to get it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
&quot; don &quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for doing so far out of the sea , that you didn &apos;t grow the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re essentially a world .
this <unk> from <unk> to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one ? what feeds you ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great . &quot; i said .
and that evening , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called up the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t make a sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to have an hour .
well , i &apos;m <unk> with a few people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer , until finally , with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t .
&quot; don &quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; what for instance , are a sustainable proteins ? &quot;
now , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , waste , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , how much of your brain is chicken ? &quot;
perhaps two percent of maybe two .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t say what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i <unk> that fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i actually have <unk> out of this fish , because , i swear to god who tasted fish after this conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic species , the way you learn your fish , the better you learn your fish , you love the fish more .
i first ate it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had spoken about this fish .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came up with a bright table with a bright , almost white white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
wait twice .
and amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can let you taste a fish that &apos;s going to be <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on what was essentially the wetlands .
they did that by <unk> the country .
they built this complicated episode of channels and <unk> water from the land and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economically .
and it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are for those places .
so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally <unk> the levers .
instead of the water <unk> , they used the channels to <unk> the water back .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a $ 11,000 hectares of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company to the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen this .
they look at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of the crocodile to the kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we struggled through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , i have <unk> up to my knees and <unk> .
here he picks up a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of bundle that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent the greatest part of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
and i asked him how he &apos;s become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and fall into more <unk> of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had at <unk> .
so i interrupted it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it get your fish as well ? &quot;
he showed up to the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that there &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the plankton plankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
you know , ever heard of a farm that their animals don &apos;t feeds ?
and later on the day , i went on on this site with <unk> , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; unlike every farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , as if a director had a film for a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve been bow around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker of <unk> , which literally is going to have pinker carpet so far the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now last year , it was the site on this particular site , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest and the most important private history in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a great <unk> <unk> , not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the power of the gut , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink the <unk> . a farm that their animals didn &apos;t feeds , and a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this is not going to be there .
they breed in a city around 240 miles , where the <unk> is better for <unk> .
and they fly every morning to the farm every morning .
and they fly down every night .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of trip of the penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> , fly around for the farm and fly it back to the evening ?
do that for the kids ? &quot;
and he looked at me as i had just quoted a song by whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;ll almost never do with it .
and yet , when i tried that restaurant in <unk> , it didn &apos;t even tasted <unk> .
she liked sweet and pure , as if you took a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> , and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last <unk> before something in the body .
it &apos;s evolved in evolution over the course of the evolution . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feeds the fish , a farm , measuring their success at success .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he <unk> it , because the water that flows through this farm is flowing in the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are rivers today , they have chemical pollutants , chemistry pollutants , drain .
and if it fought through the system , and that leaves , the water is clean , than how it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that their animals didn &apos;t feeding , not just a farm that measures their success at the success of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , how romantic always , is also <unk> .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
so what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , in fact taste good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit of radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love small <unk> . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that that &apos;s the things that the future of good food is to tell the future , somebody says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we have enough calories to feed the world more than only .
a billion people are becoming starving .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of these <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because you have the logic of the last 50 years .
they feed grain , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time , the agribusiness , just asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the easy one . it was the business business plan .
we should call them what it is , an industry in <unk> , an industry in <unk> , the very fast amount of capital that is going to do is allow that production .
this is not an craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
we &apos;re threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but from fresh water , not by <unk> , but through forests , not by <unk> and nets , but through fish in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions to feed each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> of the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in it , and it never produces something good for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that , in two billion years , <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses , that instead of <unk> , businesses , the <unk> are growing , rather than just intense , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to illustrate you today , the whole thing of the data that we consume , is greater than the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about <unk> , i want you to think about how we can use information , and we can see trends that have otherwise not become visible .
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a single cause of death , we say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , the people are the most active , and they &apos;re over here on the <unk> .
we can go out a step further , and then <unk> the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we &apos;re moving on and at age by age , we &apos;ll see 40 years or younger we see that accidents are even the major source of people to worry about people .
and who &apos;s true , and who &apos;s really true in men .
so you can see that this look at information and data in this way of swimming in a lively sense .
and if we can do this for data , why not the content itself ?
now , what we &apos;ve got here is the <unk> of every single <unk> sport that has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk in their rooms .
with <unk> , they can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump right into a particular issue .
now , when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the <unk> .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong fan , so i click here , and i click here , all of them in which lance armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a <unk> overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything about the subject ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to take a step back and take a view of view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and that &apos;s how you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , then you don &apos;t want to look or don &apos;t just be just <unk> .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
i want to do this idea a little bit more about what is a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single one of them and reduced it to a little summary .
the summary contains a short look , and a symbol of the area that she comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the popular ones .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get an idea about the issues that are at the top of wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
now , after i elected &apos; government , i know that the <unk> , which are most of these things that are <unk> at the most of these things .
this is really important because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t have a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back and looking at the whole thing .
looking at a certain of that summaries , i can go into the theme of time <unk> &quot; people &apos; year , &quot; and all of them see together .
now , when i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are <unk> . some people come from science -- some , less , come from economics . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the grid , as if it &apos;s really a network , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little bit of a surprise could be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites that -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step , and i can jump directly into a specific <unk> .
that &apos;s why , because you &apos;re just looking at pages of websites in this way , and look at all the <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom in in a particular place of time .
so here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i held up to here .
and i can sort of say anything i &apos;ve looked at today , again .
and when i look back a step back and look at everything , i can rearrange my trajectory , maybe after my <unk> , here , i looked for <unk> , looking for bing , or here after live labs of <unk> .
and from here , i can walk into the site and go back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that will be used again , and every time it makes the big big picture than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar curse .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , start to go from many things to a lot of things , and by seeing patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , then you get these past <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , rather than just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we learn to know , then we can even pull out <unk> .
i hear that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion science fiction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus , every day an hour of a track .
and my nose had always put in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts in other worlds and in a <unk> way my deep deeply <unk> in my own , voracious curiosity <unk> .
and this curiosity also showed that i was not in school , when i was not in school , and went through the forests , and went and collected , frogs and snakes and bugs , everything brought back home and looked at it under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the boundaries of the possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that are animals and places and a world of wonder that we never could have imagined .
now , that &apos;s really good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s no video games , there were no video games that had these <unk> movies that gave the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all of that . when we were children to read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen in our heads .
and my reaction is to draw and draw from aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all the things .
i was constantly caught by the teacher &apos;s teacher , like me hidden out textbook , <unk> .
creativity had to go out .
and something interesting happened . what fascinated me to jacques <unk> &apos;s shows was the idea of an entirely unknown world on our earth .
i certainly would never get an alien world to a spaceship . that seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually entered , here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all of the things i &apos;ve ever imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 to the diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me stop .
i <unk> my father until finally a <unk> in buffalo , new york , found , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that have been <unk> , i spent about three hours under water -- 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in life &apos;s life , like we really barely imagined .
the imagination of nature does not know boundaries , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding with the same intensity as ever .
and then when i got a profession , it was the filmmaking .
this seemed to be the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories , with my need , to unite images .
as a child , i was constantly drawing in comic books and so .
so films were going to bring pictures and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m talking about , from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to get my preference for the <unk> and the filmmaking <unk> .
so basically my two passions .
and something interesting happened in <unk> : to solve a <unk> problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we picked up on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
and what came out of that was the first <unk> <unk> ever in a movie .
it didn &apos;t make any money in the process , which was actually , in fact , he played the manufacturing process , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was <unk> from the magic that came out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law &apos;s law &apos;s law , and it &apos;s not magic to tell each other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , it &apos;s got to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , even a lot further .
together with <unk> , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and the success depended on how this effect would get .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve already got a little bit more money on the film .
and from those two experiences , we &apos;ve been able to do a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend stan , who was the best <unk> and <unk> , which was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
so the basic idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes , analog processes with visual printers etc .
and then we also did , and we did a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually founded the company , actually , to slow down .
i had written this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the bar of visual effects and <unk> effects in new heights of new heights , with these kinds of examples of <unk> , expressive characters that have been made by <unk> , and the <unk> should be all <unk> . and the <unk> should be <unk> .
but it pushed the bar back , and the people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t been able to do this .
so i shifted this and made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , and it became an <unk> <unk> order , a passionate movie .
but i was actually trying to <unk> the real rise of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced them , but i said , &quot; we come up to the wreckage . we &apos;re film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> film .
that &apos;s tremendously important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s going back again , that your imagination can make a reality .
we then then created six months later , where i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a film , no <unk> , which was real .
so , that really blew my mind .
and the preparation of this was enormous . we had to build cameras and so on .
and i noticed how much of these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> more sophisticated planning .
you go into that capsule , you &apos;re floating down into this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is to rescue , if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> .
it &apos;s cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , from part of doing curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to think of a creature that we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the <unk> .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and the science at the time we saw them , when we saw them .
so , that &apos;s really <unk> me , and i wanted more .
and so i met an unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood in hollywood and put in hollywood for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we showed up to the <unk> , and we explored with <unk> .
we went back to the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to look at the internal of the ship , which has never been done before .
no one had explored the inside of the <unk> ; you didn &apos;t have a resources for that . so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , which are kind of like this <unk> here , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i &apos;m going to take a fly through a little <unk> <unk> from the ship .
it &apos;s actually only , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;m physically within the titanic .
this was the most powerful form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner , i always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because months of the vehicle i ran when we did the film .
and the set was actually an accurate copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints .
so that was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize that you can use such <unk> <unk> , and so your conscious mind can make your own awareness in the vehicle into this other form of existence .
it was really extremely profound .
and maybe a little look at what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> to study something or to do things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> , which i can imagine as a <unk> .
and after that expeditions , we started what we &apos;ve seen at the bottom of the bottom , really appreciate , for example , this <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . this is like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in one of sunlight , as we do that .
and this is what you see animals right next to a 500 degrees celsius that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , and this was back from my childhood again .
and so i ended up looking at the people who are interested in space and to do with nasa , and they &apos;re sitting in <unk> and <unk> , and they go to russia , go through the mission of the <unk> protocol , and everything that &apos;s going to <unk> , then fly to international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was on the end that i took <unk> with us to the deep sea .
i took them up and <unk> them to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in those extreme situations , and i took them around to the vents so they could take and test them , take a look and instruments and testing instruments .
we made documentaries , but in fact , in fact , science , we were doing science , actually , <unk> .
so , the circle of my existence closed , as a child , was at the time as a child , and the practice in reality .
and over the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re certainly thinking , a director must be able to have a leader , like a <unk> or something .
i don &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i <unk> this expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t give us any money .
we just play the manufacturing costs , of fame .
everybody thinks i &apos;m between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have <unk> the nails on one towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task of will , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there are , and because of the weird connection that comes out , and because of the weird connection that comes out of a small group of people .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked with years and years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row in a row .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning that you have in front of each other is because you overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain any other .
when you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole technique , and the whole technique , when you &apos;re working at lake , and the difficulty of the brain , when you &apos;re working at lake , and you can &apos;t explain the other thing .
there is a connection , an mutual respect .
and so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you respected his team and make their respect in return .
that &apos;s what the dynamic really changed .
and so , again , i stood up with a small team on <unk> terrain , and we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
incredibly exciting .
an awful challenge .
and we have been a <unk> period for a half a half years .
and it changed my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who thought we were doing really well <unk> and transported on the planet pandora .
for me , it was more of a <unk> way of doing my job , the actual process that changed the outcome .
so what can we come from all of that ?
what did we learn ?
i think the first place is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
to me , the young filmmakers say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t get one .
that &apos;s another thing for you . don &apos;t do you yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and studying failure , we need to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> that you guarantee .
not an important achievement , the innovation demanded , has ever been addressed .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to give you to the way . fail is not an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may be surprising to me , because my <unk> in the foundation of vaccines and seed is about the things we invent and provide the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years . it &apos;s too much rain , and it &apos;s going to rain too little , and things will change their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , climate change will become a terrible thing for you .
and it &apos;s also very important to them .
the fact is that if you could only reduce the cost of one thing , to <unk> , energy would be far from the most effective .
well , the <unk> is just like that .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution in the 20th century , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and so we have refrigerators , <unk> , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the price down -- let &apos;s take the price in half -- we get to a new barrier and the barrier of co2 with co2 .
co2 warms up the planet , and the equation of co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 that leads to the <unk> , and that <unk> has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the <unk> result , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to themselves , can &apos;t adapt , and make whole systems .
well , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where the other consequences are , there are some questions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these are going to follow , but you &apos;ll be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> several times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t that half , or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to continue .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a <unk> of a <unk> of a bridge that has to be under a three square meter , and then you put it <unk> .
this has to go down to the bottom , zero .
well , we run a lot of <unk> in a lot of 26 billion tons .
each americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
the average is about five tons of anybody on the planet .
and somehow , we need to create changes that lower it to zero .
it has gone up far .
only different economic changes have affected it at all , and we need to go from <unk> increases , and a reduction in zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little multiplication . you &apos;ve got this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to be a zero to zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people on the number , the average energy for every service and the co2 that &apos;s <unk> per person .
so let &apos;s look at each one in a factor , and let &apos;s think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now this is a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
we first have the population .
today , <unk> billion people live .
and it &apos;s going to look at nine billion <unk> that are going on to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines that are <unk> and <unk> , we could reduce it by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
and these are very good things and <unk> , to make these services almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make <unk> and less use , but that number is going to increase the number every year , and so much more than double , the number of services that are available per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . there &apos;s light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , for efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
because of different successes in <unk> , through other <unk> , through new ways , through new ways , there are lots of services that are some individual services to reduce 90 percent .
in other of the service , like manufacturing <unk> , 105 2 : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / <unk> , the window of improvements is a lot smaller .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a factor of three or maybe even a factor of three .
but in the first three factors , we are now from 26 billion to maybe <unk> billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s <unk> per unit .
it turns out the question you can get to zero .
when you burn coal , no .
if you burn gas , no .
almost every energy economy for electricity today today , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the word &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to a lot of these miracle .
they usually don &apos;t have any deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just wrong , and some of them are coming , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we need to give <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i get it out ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the idea of people here ?
i remember last year when i got mosquitos and i kind of like people .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
that &apos;s what i noticed .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , you don &apos;t even want to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they all do not much .
we need solutions , either one or multiple <unk> and unimaginable <unk> , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i actually see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
this may be a <unk> contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my statement here is that we have to work on all of those five work , and we can &apos;t give up by them because they all have significant problems .
first of all , we &apos;re going to burn fossil fuels from either coal or natural gas .
what you &apos;ve got to do there seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to have all the co2 that comes out of the top of the <unk> , capture , under pressure , and then store somewhere and hope that it remains .
there are some <unk> that are going to create 60 percent , 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get to 100 percent , and a agreement for the <unk> of co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who is going to make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough problem .
next : <unk> .
there &apos;s also three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , the question of security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human participation that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five , i have summarized .
it &apos;s renewables as they are often called .
and they also have -- even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that these technologies are producing dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , a thousand times more area than a normal power station .
also , these sources of <unk> sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , it doesn &apos;t change the wind all day .
and therefore , if you depend on these sources , you have a way to get the energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say , for example , that the power of power is outside the country , they don &apos;t need the technology , you need to deal with the risk that the energy of where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at this : the cars , computers , cell phones , <unk> , for everything . and i found that all the batteries that use the world , i found out that all the batteries , which we can now make less than 10 minutes of <unk> camps .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be 100 better than a factor of time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to get 20 percent of them -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to be 100 percent on it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many , you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group there are many people who are already engaged here .
bill big has several companies , among other companies , who has a great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of thousands of companies doing great things , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company , which is perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
now , the evolution in this industry stopped a few time ago , so there &apos;s no great surprise that some good concepts around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had thought about it for a long time , but you could never simulate anything that &apos;s going to work , but you can simulate modern supercomputers since you can see it , and you can see that it &apos;s going to be functioning .
and because you burn that 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today as a <unk> .
but instead of breaking your head on it , you just burn it . a great thing .
so the uranium becomes incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that there &apos;s a kind of column that often refer to a <unk> wave reactor .
that really solves the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that will be burned today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that &apos;s where the u.s. u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you get <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are still many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many people are talking about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture , and hopefully it &apos;s going to be <unk> and cement , until there are .
so , to reach that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , are completely <unk> .
the other note says whether we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key feature of this <unk> .
if we go from there , what should the 2020 look like ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to get reduction on reducing reduction , and the less we <unk> , the smaller the <unk> will be , and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we do , which are not fully to the big <unk> , just the same , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to follow these breakthroughs , and we can track that , and we can measure that in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> , &quot; <unk> energy <unk> the air . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework where this can be discussed wide , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s some things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very <unk> wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and that &apos;s what i love , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , that wish i would take .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it will be <unk> between the long term and in the short term and in the short term , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and china , and almost all life of this two billion will be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research .
when countries come together in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk about these <unk> , and they would be shocked by <unk> low funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we have to dialogue and live full , and also the things that are being done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first , can you give us an idea of the scale of these investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation of a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it works , you &apos;re only in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> , more billion , the <unk> and the place of actually building the first of it .
once the first thing is finished , when it &apos;s as i promised , it &apos;s all very clear , because the energy density , the energy density is so different than how we know it .
and to understand this , that means to build deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column of the floor like a vertical column , and then the process starts up , and then the process goes up and is working further down ?
<unk> : right . now , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of the control that can go wrong , this thing where you open it up and <unk> things , and that &apos;s not good !
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can take it for 60 years -- think of a column that you &apos;d buried without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burn 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which offers a solution to the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can let him sit -- there &apos;s a lot less garbage with that method -- you take it up and put it into the next reactor , and you &apos;ll burn it up .
and we start by taking the waste that &apos;s already there , which is in these <unk> or <unk> , which is our <unk> .
so this is a problem for these reactors , which is what we fill in our filling and so it will dramatically reduce the <unk> in the process .
but while they &apos;ve talked to different people around the world .
where is the biggest interest in what really does ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t set us to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting pieces of <unk> for everything that carries a &quot; nuclear , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of interest and people in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i met the <unk> and talked about how it fits to the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have done something .
this is a variant of the thing that has been done .
and that &apos;s an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , that &apos;s why anybody who did a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and chance of doing something like this ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is sort of the deadline that we &apos;ve shown us the <unk> that we have .
and , you know , <unk> , when everything is good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it might be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , the ones , the same , if their approaches to work for their pilots could work for their pilots .
and it would be best if it &apos;s multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the big possible breakthroughs , is this the greatest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would have been without the <unk> , but it would be so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> , which seems to be a difficult thing , but maybe they say about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about it is that a <unk> has a million times as much energy as one , say , a <unk> , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re basically the radiation that &apos;s going to play in the problems , and that &apos;s what the potential is , it &apos;s almost in a own league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you ate too much , and you &apos;re going to have a heart attack on a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> that deals with various techniques , to delay warming , so that we &apos;d be for 20 or 30 years longer for us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you should not work on insurance , because you might be lazy to do that , so you might keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save a <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if the fact is smart , if you run the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> , whether you should have that , if things come faster , and that innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences to you , to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are very different camps .
those who do scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there &apos;s a negative impact that we have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can do at all , which there is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is like aids .
you make the mistake right now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems that you have all kinds of problems to invest in something that you &apos;re just later on , which is that the investment doesn &apos;t necessarily be so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world , and there &apos;s no big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skeptics goes away , then the skeptics are going to say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it because it &apos;s cheaper , i &apos;m going to accept that it &apos;s cheaper than the previous way . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you &apos;re using all of that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that we suffer from , the <unk> , which requires a legal waste of resources , to invest money , and so that it &apos;s a dumb waste of resources to invest in , while there &apos;s better things we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- say we should spend the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than you &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t suffer from other things .
you get too large <unk> , and you can disagree with you here , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that , and that &apos;s what happens to me is most of a waste .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> , and we &apos;re doing only the learning curve , and i think we should try and do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the <unk> you get , it &apos;s a very high <unk> , you can only keep it up .
i mean , each one of us here could spend five times so much on our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinking .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why isn &apos;t the research going to work anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , with <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why it makes it a very lonely group .
and this is a student i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it will support .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk for almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> introduced a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and the idea is quite simple . <unk> needs to be <unk> &apos;s maximum structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter tape , about three feet and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard to work , because people work very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s something about the task of what deep impressions of the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them .
normally most people start to start with them in the task .
they &apos;re talking about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s <unk> .
and then they invest a little bit in planning and organization , and they &apos;re drawing and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re putting a lot of their time in the <unk> .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone &apos;s taking the marshmallow and you put it gently down on the top , step back and <unk> ! admire her work .
but then , what &apos;s happened , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be a &quot; <unk> &quot; because the weight of the <unk> causes the whole thing , bend and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more <unk> than others , and under the <unk> are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused and they really produce <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and under the best are <unk> graduate students .
and this is pretty amazing .
like peter , they don &apos;t just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering : how does that come ? why ? what about those ?
and peter said , &quot; none of the kids invest in the head of spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> is doing is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they &apos;re <unk> to repair prototypes .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> .
and with each attempt , the kids get immediate feedback that works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of them is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers , but not much , more powerful than adults are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
three feet is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns , the key to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average , but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
you put an <unk> administrator on the team , you &apos;ll significantly better better .
it &apos;s incredible . you &apos;re looking around and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they conduct the process , you understand it .
and that team that <unk> the water and on work is actually going to get dramatically improving .
specialized skills and <unk> and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams , they get about six , the robust structures .
so i tried something interesting .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the <unk> right .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize for the winner .
what happened to do with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened here . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody built a <unk> high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so , is it not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we repeat these practice with the same students .
so what happened now ?
now , you understand the benefit of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so , from the same , bad team was one of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually invest in a <unk> ?
the reason is , i &apos;ll help help create digital tools and processes to help teams get cars and video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does , it helps to identify hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or ethos to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , you can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples of all around the world how people optimize and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it demands that we all put our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimal , like our emotions and our do , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is to take us away from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so we &apos;re going to have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; they can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends at last time , and they wanted to go to all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america seeks the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you &apos;re kind of drawn to the <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because possibilities on the planet are not going back on the planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that has ever been on the planet , no matter what scale you are using : health , wealth , mobility , declining <unk> .
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my <unk> died all died when they were 60 .
my grandparents kept holding this number .
my parents are the 80 at <unk> .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born today in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have <unk> the demographics in the earth in a way that no war ever did .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve got them <unk> . pop .
in the rich world , there are diseases that millions of us are still threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of scientific method .
and from my perspective , the scientific method of trying to try and see if it works , it &apos;s changing , if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people on this world are going to bed every day in the world every day .
that number goes up , and it &apos;s very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and in case we &apos;re not going to disappear from this chaos , we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live on to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they &apos;re not at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is just awake at night -- one of the things that i keep awake at night , we haven &apos;t needed scientific progress as well as now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it in the way that we can do it today .
we &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet , i really think we &apos;d have to go back to that , 300 years from the enlightenment , to find a time where we have a time in progress that we have in progress on more times more than now .
people make themselves feel so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
it &apos;s not even the truth .
and listen , everybody has a right in his mind ; even a right in his mind .
but you know where you don &apos;t have a right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to find out .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written an article about vaccination for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed at resistance , on resistance to what is the end of the most effective health system in the history of human health .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetically modified food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i was also writing an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they thought that molecules in a particular kind of <unk> was a <unk> <unk> in the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we get rich , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that were crazy at all , they were not <unk> at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that got me so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we are not the same relationship with progress on the time .
we &apos;re talking <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about this , with little , quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what they are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , sometimes lost in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it wasn &apos;t that way .
you can just call a few names and people get to understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were always right . be skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
take nothing for granted .
but now it &apos;s coming : if you get evidence to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that from the reason that we live in an epidemic of fear , as i haven &apos;t seen it , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which was the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very frightening .
there were tons of studies to see if that was true .
countless studies should be done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , in england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no connection , no connection , not at all .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t think of a bunch of documents on a <unk> that &apos;s given us data , and i understand that , i think we &apos;re all doing that .
but you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
devastating because of the united states , one of the only countries in the world , is one of the only countries in the world that are falling down for measles .
that &apos;s <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody have measles ?
has a single audience ever seen on measles ?
happens not very often .
happens in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
these are a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can actually be in denial , and people like jenny can be <unk> around and messages from platforms like oprah and larry king , live by platforms like oprah and larry king .
and they can do that because they can &apos;t connect and correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but it &apos;s almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst human rights humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , go .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
it &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he has just evolved with a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , five children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul walking around and vaccines , and says how valuable they are , and that people just should stop <unk> .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul <unk> talks , he can &apos;t tell arms of <unk> .
he &apos;s got calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , return the disease , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we have measles in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children are going to die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a <unk> of mine has written me a couple of weeks ago , and she said i &apos;m a bit to <unk> .
nobody has said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t get your child against <unk> kids . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s somebody in lagos today in lagos , and it &apos;s going to go to los angeles , right now , in ohio moment .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and it &apos;s coming to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to make ourselves lying . we love that .
did you take all their vitamins tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you the leaps .
i know they did that because half of americans make it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , they want to want to be 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not do that . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us , and <unk> ourselves , who can afford it .
so we &apos;re going to walk away , and where we &apos;re going ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it &apos;s really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions dollars .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of props here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , and people say to me and say , &quot; what does it care ? let &apos;s do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not adopt the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any <unk> that can treat his patients with <unk> .
if they go to this path where i believe and magic evidence and science replace science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he was bringing 400,000 his people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country , which will be worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> genetically engineered food and the <unk> system .
that &apos;s a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , for metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch , has changed by people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did it all .
we did it over the last 11,000 years .
and some of them didn &apos;t work and not work .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now , we can make it more specifically . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we dismiss a lot of food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing about is a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to do huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent in companies .
we don &apos;t want companies own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it works , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of being a very <unk> , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that &apos;s going to eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s about the potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it has no protein , and scientists are building all this right now .
and then people could eat the food and not blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to that is , why do we do that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we do that ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re doing so far , we &apos;re guilty of something that we do , i think , i think not want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our <unk> , and we have to really stop that .
so , after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to do this ridiculous time and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i want to do that .
right now , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine , we &apos;re going to be happy to do that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> . it may seem odd that a magician was interested in it , unless you look at it as a &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be real when someone only believes enough . &quot;
in other words , there &apos;s a measurable effect in some studies , which is a measurable effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to her , is a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , if the patient , for sure , is a measurable effect on the body called the <unk> .
a deception becomes something real because somebody perceives it .
and so we also understand each other , now i want to show you a basic , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in every <unk> for children .
i even studied him from <unk> <unk> magic of magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then explain him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my own .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing goes away from my sleeve or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to <unk> my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time to move anything , and as long as i get here , nothing can go out in my sleeves .
and the goal with this is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is good , the knife will be held by my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting in the place that i can shake it , without your knife .
nothing goes in my sleeves or comes out , no <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often do a little bit of little kids , which is magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , when you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
now , many of you are here in the room this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i <unk> my wrist , to make sure that nothing goes away from my sleeve , or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist , is that there is the secret of the illusion .
because in the moment , where i &apos;m putting my hand from you , so you can see them from the back , this finger here , just from where he was , just where he was in a position where he &apos;s so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back there who had no childhood .
so he &apos;s here . right .
and when i zoom in , the fingers will change his position .
and now you could talk about why that &apos;s a deception , why you don &apos;t realize here just three fingers down here : because the mind and the way he processed information , it doesn &apos;t matter , one , two , three , but it looks like it .
but that &apos;s not really what it does . and then i open my hand .
of course it will be held there , but not by magnetism in my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing that happens to me is <unk> me through this movement , that your fingers are back .
i &apos;ll take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
that &apos;s a trick for your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the <unk> ?
one year ago , i read a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me .
because it turns out to be this : if you provide a placebo placebo against a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular effect .
but if you get the shape that you give it to placebo , for example , change in a smaller pill , and change these blue and a letter on it , is actually measurable more effective .
and that , although none of those are <unk> -- they &apos;re just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freak out .
but it turns out that this is not all .
if you take capsules that are even more effective than pills are .
a colored capsule , which is in the end of the end , is better red , is better than a white capsule .
the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
-- that &apos;s also a role to play .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate car , you have to reach into the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a pair of <unk> substance that you injected into a patient .
that creates a very strong picture in the head . that &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t appear as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
and none of it has a really <unk> property , and it &apos;s just our belief in which a stronger impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let &apos;s look real .
now , we know from the study that you have to reach into the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is an 18 inches of a long time . she &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to take you a little bit of it .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , stick through it , and it <unk> until it <unk> on the other side .
if you &apos;re kind of <unk> -- when they drop out to pass -- i put this a bunch of friends in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman that i didn &apos;t know .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be bad at the next 30 seconds , look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also <unk> if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , on the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to just make a small <unk> .
sorry . do you make it crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had the <unk> .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , this is not so dumb and <unk> itself , just to have a couple of minutes to speak . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
the people in the <unk> are coming in .
let me show you from a nearby .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can do the <unk> .
sorry . if you &apos;re <unk> , look bad , look away .
the people in the back , or the ones that later you see on video later , will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , he would -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and there if it really were , it would bleed up . &quot;
okay , let me take some blood for you .
yeah , there it is .
now , normally i would take the needle .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this context , and with the intention of being a deception , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle just in there and go from stage .
we &apos;re going to face a few times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll look forward . thank you very much .
everyone is talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people who count the number of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave up to about 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite working all this tide of work , there are several cognitive ones that are sort of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive heads .
this is true for <unk> that are thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s a lot of scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as confused as everyone else .
the first one of them fall is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could narrow it , but in the big and whole , this is something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to need to take the complicated perspective on what &apos;s well-being .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory : basically , you &apos;re going to be between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my lectures , who said a story , &#91; unclear &#93; &#93; , he said he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely a symphony at the end of the recording , which was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he added , really , pretty emotional , that has ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what &apos;s ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes <unk> music .
they &apos;re not talking about it because he was a memory ; the memory was ruined , and that memory was all he got to keep it .
what that really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , which is the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i put you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the history of our life gets upright , and it &apos;s the one that makes the doctor saying , &quot; how did you feel at last time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two are part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories if we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is , what we need to keep our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients , which is a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked , all 60 seconds about her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more suffered ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient was a much worse than a patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the worse , which is worse , where the pain was at the end of the end , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing all over ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the <unk> .
well , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of view of the <unk> self , b was clearly a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient is , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s going to work , you could actually get the <unk> to a patient by just rolling up the hose without <unk> .
this is going to lead to the patient , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve made it , that the <unk> self is off by patient , and you made it that the <unk> itself is a much better off , because now you &apos;ve given a better story about your experience .
what is what draws a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory is , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
and so a story of <unk> are different and important moments and end .
end ends up very , very important , and in this case , <unk> the end .
now the <unk> self lives his life continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and you ask : what happens with those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , the psychological presence of the present than about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600,000 million of them . in a month it &apos;s about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave behind .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you just get the impression that you should count , that what happens during these moments of <unk> is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we consume while we are in the world .
and how we use them seem important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> self .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> self , there &apos;s a <unk> vacation on the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories of it .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is a critical variable that is a <unk> self from a <unk> self . time has very little impact on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who , say , two different <unk> in two different surgeons and decides how to choose , then it &apos;s the ability to pick up the one who &apos;s remembered , which is a surgeon that &apos;s selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experience .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which sort of <unk> the <unk> itself through experiences that don &apos;t need the <unk> self .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday on a very common case , which is , we &apos;re doing <unk> on vacation in the services of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little difficult to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about this , i think on a holiday we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , the fact that i &apos;ve ever had the best holiday i &apos;ve ever had , and i think relatively often in relation to others .
and i &apos;ve probably got my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had to open the folder with the 600 images i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we spending memories so much weight in the cost of the weight that we give experience .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the <unk> , all of their images are wiped out , and they get a <unk> drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you &apos;re going to vote on a holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self , and you need to think about how they &apos;re going to decide that conflict , and that &apos;s not obvious at all , because if you think of time in the sense of time , you might get an answer . and if you think of memories , you might get another answer .
why we choose the <unk> , which we choose is a problem that gives us a choice between the two species .
well , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unk> itself over time .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted is the person when this person thinks about your life .
very different term .
now , everyone who doesn &apos;t make these terms is different to try and screw the happiness out of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being that have the study of happiness long , in exactly the same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and the happiness of the <unk> itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people are asked questions about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of both species .
and the main lesson we have learned is that they are really different .
you can know how happy somebody with his life is , and it doesn &apos;t teach you a lot about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you hit someone , and you would say , oh , your father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you would know something about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much insecurity .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life as eight to a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is low .
we know about what happiness is determined .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means mostly to be happy with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize the two types of self , they &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
so the implication of what i &apos;ve been saying here is that we &apos;re really lucky enough to think of a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , quite short , another reason we can &apos;t think of happiness is that we &apos;re not looking at the same things when we &apos;re thinking about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier when they say , we &apos;re living in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , we say , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out we &apos;re not very important to the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
well , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california at the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who are moving to california , to become happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to become happier yourself .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how awful the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that they &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we look at the phone a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting result that the gallup survey came out of this gallup survey .
is this something that you can play on , because now you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we absolutely haven &apos;t anticipated .
and we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we were looking at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , under 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under 600,000 dollars a year in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become more happy , the poorer they will .
we get an absolutely flat line on that .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen so flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money doesn &apos;t raise a <unk> , but that lack of money certainly bought , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you make . they &apos;re happier .
it &apos;s not true .
but danny , throughout american endeavor , about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take these <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , all we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there an opportunity that a politician , in general , is that the country would take a <unk> like seriously , and it would make politics based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i believe that there is recognition for the role of education in politics .
the recognition will be slow , in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , they &apos;re happening right now and in other countries .
people are saying that you should recognize happiness , when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether you want to explore <unk> , or whether they want to explore <unk> , so we have to have this conversation quite soon .
as you &apos;re lucky , you can get very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
it will affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you start to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades , the next one or two decades .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should at least be the most interesting political debate over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , how to save in <unk> .
i have a plan . i want to convince you more people , including all of you , to spend more time with playing bigger and playing games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time in games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
in fact , in my research at the institute of the future , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most important problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time .
i have calculated that it &apos;s time at 21 billion hours a week .
now , this seems perhaps a little bit of <unk> , so i repeat it to work with it : if we want to work on problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , to solve global conflict and obesity , i think we need to do games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i &apos;m really serious .
why ? this picture is quite exactly why i think games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographers .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he &apos;s got a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic words in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nuances are in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , some fear , but also very focus in the problem of solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you &apos;re looking at some nuances here , and the mouths are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows will surprise a surprise .
this is a player on the edge of something called the <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so very positive that you didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked to actually be able to actually be able to do that . this is an <unk> victory .
this player is just a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on a million faces from <unk> around the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of all the <unk> on the edge of the <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we look at this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i refer to it as a &quot; life &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m like to do , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad .
this is an graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was studying why i was studying why we were doing better than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as playing in the reality .
and i don &apos;t just have less successful , even though that &apos;s about it .
we &apos;re getting into <unk> more . i mean , in the context of motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired to collaboration .
if we are in a <unk> , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version at any time , and to be helpful at any time , you &apos;re going to try to solve the problem , as long as need to try and try it again .
and in reality , when we &apos;re failing , when we run out of obstacles , we &apos;re often feeling different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated us . we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings we never have when we play games , they just don &apos;t have it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to be able to think , to think , you could not just do everything ?
how can we put these feelings out into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to the collaborative problem problem .
and i found a couple of things that won the epic journey in <unk> .
so first , when you go into one of these <unk> , especially in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to <unk> you , you know , a <unk> mission .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to their current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so you have a lot of time , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you spin . there are always something important to do something important .
and there are lots of collaborators .
where you &apos;re also going to go , hundreds of thousands of people working together to end with their epic epic mission .
that &apos;s not as easy in the real life , that feeling that there are tons of lots of employees in there .
also , there &apos;s this epic epic story , that inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard of &quot; level up , &quot; and &quot; plus-one <unk> &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
that constant feedback is not in true life .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have to go to go and say a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get in the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of <unk> like world &apos;s world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time on the edge of the <unk> , that we would rather spend all our time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world &apos;s world &apos;s world has spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started walking upright .
so the first and so primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend now with play right now , that &apos;s just when you hold time in terms of scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also appropriate . because it turns out we &apos;re using all this time to play , actually , what we &apos;re going to be able to do as humans .
we &apos;re developing ourselves into collaborative thinking .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
if you look at this interesting statistic , recently , who was published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university , the average young human being published in a country has 10,000 hours with <unk> to the age of 21 .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , <unk> hours are the precise <unk> that they spend in school five to the end of the high school -- if you &apos;re never missing .
so we &apos;ve got a complete <unk> , on the young people learning , what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of any subject to the 21st of 12 , we &apos;re going to master it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are players doing good ? &quot;
because if we could figure this out , we would actually have never been there to have any of the potential of human potential .
so many people are in the world right now in the world that spend at least an hour per day per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are remarkably good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed <unk> that save energy and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect another billion players in the next decade .
and so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is to make us master .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do , immediately , to do something , and we have to believe that we have an educated hope of success .
players believe that an <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and that &apos;s the same .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters in social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like people to do , after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they have defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game .
we do trust that a time with us spends that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and to stay in the process .
so the <unk> allows the <unk> of <unk> , trust , and with each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> 22 hours a week , like <unk> .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or do nothing .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re going to work optimal , if we do hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become a part of awe and part of awe at <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> to go back to the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki wiki , at almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than any other subject in any other wiki in the world .
they create a epic epic story .
they create a epic epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers lead to a single outcome , players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we won &apos;t see less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and it &apos;s logical . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i &apos;m going to develop games , i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that that makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life .
you can make stronger social ties in games than in real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says , well , it &apos;s completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than there .
i &apos;m just going to agree with it , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start changing the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from an event for 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> , there was <unk> .
and these were kind of the first people developed by the first of people .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the old greek <unk> <unk> , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , games were invented , more <unk> , during a famine while a famine .
there was such great famine that the king of <unk> decided to be a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they were going to be so excited in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and we were surrounded with <unk> , <unk> productivity , they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and so for 18 years , they survived these famine for 18 years by eating these famine , and they were playing on a day .
likewise , i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
we &apos;re playing games to escape the world &apos;s suffering .
we &apos;re playing games to everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need from play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better years , so the king , the king , is a <unk> <unk> .
they divided the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a <unk> , and they were allowed to break into a <unk> adventure .
they were leaving , and they went to search for a new home . they just let me go back so many people to survive , and they were looking for the rest to the rest of the place where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> , which was later the roman realm later , that have the same dna in the same way .
and so scientists recently came to the notion that <unk> &apos;s crazy story came in .
and geologists found the evidence of a global development system that took almost 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story might vote .
you may have actually saved their people through games for 18 years , and then they had these <unk> , and then they had a lot of time to play with each other , that they had saved the entire civilization .
so we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 warcraft .
this was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> , which was 16 years ago .
they were playing <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;d argue that we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be able to figure out that half of us have been spending an hour per day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly the question i have dedicated my work in the institute of the future .
we &apos;ve got this banner in our office in palo alto , pushing the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people empower to empower this idea into reality .
we won &apos;t go to epic epic , and give people the opportunities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of three games that i designed to try to get people &apos;s journey in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to get through a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough <unk> to make it realistic for it , and actually , you know , it &apos;s a real life without oil , so if you sign up to the game , tell us where they live , and then you get a <unk> in real time , tell us where schools costs , whether it &apos;s rioting , and then you &apos;ll get <unk> in real time .
we tested this game with 1,700 players , and we &apos;ve been accompanied them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if they &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and i said , &quot; we go out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you go on .
find out how they were going to survive , and most of our players have their own behavior .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next online game put a greater , higher goal than just <unk> .
we developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute of the future .
starting to start with the computation of a <unk> that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputers called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to the players , on sign on sign , we &apos;ve made almost like a <unk> <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they google &quot; <unk> &quot; .
and the last game we take on the third of march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you finish the game , you get the award of the world bank award , &quot; social <unk> , &quot; in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all of sub-saharan africa , and invite them to learn the social redesign .
we have a comic book on this . we have a level high , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people , all around the world , especially in <unk> , who benefit from all of their own social enterprises to save their own social enterprises .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happened next ?
we have all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that i hope you agree with me that players are the human resources that we can use in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
so we have these all superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to knit close social networks , <unk> , and the desire for most powerful importance .
i really hope that we play meaningful games together to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me and play with me .
if i go into the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create any option imaginable and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start with the games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a couple of months ago in writing a article on a wired magazine .
i &apos;m always going to write my <unk> at the time , but i &apos;ve been working on the work of text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never been in my life in my life , which the word &quot; disabled &quot; means .
i read the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , helpless , useless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong .
and i read this list to a friend , and i had to laugh at first , he didn &apos;t work so ridiculous , but i just had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading , and they had to stop reading , and then <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that the issue has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s , when i started looking at elementary school , and started to build my sense of self outside of my family environment , and to shape , also , in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use <unk> .
if i &apos;m going to take this point seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person , whose life can be positive in any fundamental way , but today i &apos;ve experienced the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i immediately have to navigated to the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected me to find a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , they &apos;re not much better .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we think about these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the romans , have really believed that the pronunciation is a huge force , because what you can see out loud , it can be <unk> .
so , what do we actually want <unk> -- one disabled person or a powerful people ?
in fact , just to say a human being as a child , that &apos;s enough of <unk> , <unk> them , and you ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open doors ?
a human who opened up for me was a pediatrician at <unk> dupont in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name of the name , as you can think , most americans don &apos;t get rid of correctly , so he was always dr. p. .
and he used to be very colorful used , and he was just done with children with kids like this .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just as well -- to my <unk> .
i had to make a little bit of a practice for infinite times , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know to build my <unk> , and i hated them down to build my <unk> , and i hated them .
and imagine , in fact , i even had a <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so i tried to stop this thing , <unk> without success .
and one day , he was watching me at one of my work -- these practice were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you will one day tear off that shot .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. p. i &apos;m doing the exercises that i don &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that the richest to be going on in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily <unk> , and it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder today how much his vision of my vision has shaped as strong and powerful young girls , and i could imagine , as one of nature , powerful and <unk> human beings .
this is just one example of a lot of how adults can make a child &apos;s imagination .
but as they &apos;re looking at <unk> examples of the <unk> , our language doesn &apos;t let us imagine what we would all want to do : it allows every one to see themselves as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes , which were triggered by a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , you can say , of course , that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> from titan and artificial <unk> for the aging body that allows people to be able to be able to create , really all of the power and the limits that their natural destiny has to be able to define themselves in the world that you have to choose .
so perhaps this technological change is more clearly clear , because the fact that , there &apos;s always another truth , which is that every person in society can make a whole <unk> and very powerful that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i &apos;m going to say with <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable to understand the questions of people .
this sentence from the treatment of <unk> lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , to address a challenge without having been so successful , as if my life could be so successful , because i could be able to avoid the potential of a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people .
but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course we &apos;re shaped by the challenge of the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotional or even both .
and i would argue that it &apos;s good .
<unk> are not a obstacle that we need to have to be able to get to our lives better .
<unk> are just to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s all the time to me .
and i don &apos;t want to be the effect of the impact , or the <unk> of a human being .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real , and each person &apos;s going to do it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;re <unk> or not , but how we come to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to preserve <unk> , but they &apos;re also preparing to get clear to it .
and we don &apos;t actually make our kids , if we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things out of it : to be a medical fact , and you have to be amputated at the other social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability , which i had to have to have to do , is that the world is constantly saying me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are in the heart , and they &apos;re going to be the cool , hard truth about their medical projection , or even a prediction to the quality of life that you expect , we have to watch that we &apos;re not going to be disabled .
well , maybe the current concept is , it &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we repair it , to every single larger disability , as a medical condition .
if we don &apos;t treat a human people , and not all of its forces and opportunities , we can make in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead , another disease .
we <unk> a person who has value for our society .
so we need to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of what we do and our great <unk> , there is a connection .
we should not deny these <unk> times or either , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor do we go under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to recognize the most fundamental opportunity .
i think it may be more about the fact that we &apos;re not necessarily going to have to get rid of it , but that we &apos;re open to hug a <unk> , put them on the <unk> , to use a <unk> , and maybe even dance .
and maybe we can do it as a bit of natural and more powerful and useful , and feel that it doesn &apos;t feel like a lot more of their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 : the birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , has shown in something very true in the human character .
i would call it this way : not the most powerful of its kind survived , and not the <unk> of its species , but the one that can adapt to the best .
conflict creates creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of the people , to survive , is determined by the struggle of the human mind to turn itself through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skill of people .
and maybe we just know what wood is being carved from when we &apos;re actually tested .
potentially , that &apos;s exactly the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that goes beyond heavy times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> are for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we were doing , is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there is no normal .
there is the common standard . the typical one . but not the normal , and would you really know that poor , gray person to learn if they really existed ?
i don &apos;t think more .
it would be great if we &apos;re doing this paradigm of normal , or the strength , to even make it a little bit of a kind of more dangerous to formulate , we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills to society .
<unk> found that we have always found people from members of our society to be useful and to do a contribution .
there is evidence that the neanderthals were out of old years ago and people who have carried heavy physical injuries and people with heavy physical injuries , perhaps because the <unk> in the <unk> of these people was valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as being useless and useless ; they were treated as something special and value .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a <unk> in this &quot; red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there in front of a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy who says , &quot; well , if this is not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you won &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and , of course , it made it click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man , which i knew just from narratives of my mother , that day , because i , of course , typical of my birthday , came to the late birthday for two weeks .
and the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s doctor was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet were born after you , and i just had a few toes in this and a few toes in the other foot , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to deliver bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to tell your parents , you never walk , and never be as <unk> as other kids or that you could never have an independent life , and then they just lie to me . &quot;
i was really extraordinary found that he &apos;d collected my entire childhood <unk> , no matter if i had won in the second grade in the second grade , whether i was going to <unk> my scholarship or a <unk> , whether i had a scholarship or one of my <unk> and the <unk> , and he used these snippets to teach their students , <unk> , and <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x <unk> , the potential of the human will .
you can just not emphasize enough how critical of the quality of human life can be .
and dr. <unk> talked to he , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they don &apos;t always say anything else , and if they &apos;re just getting a little bit of support when you get kids themselves , you can get kids very much . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody deals with it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve also changed my thinking over time , if you had asked me at the age of 15 years , whether i had asked my prostheses against the legs of meat and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i really wanted to work normal then .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s happened because i have experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and perhaps this change could happen , because i &apos;ve been in a lot of people who have opened me up to the doors instead of asking people who cut me , or wanted to <unk> me .
you see , it really needs a person to demonstrate how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own , inner powers , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re going to open a door for those people a very good teacher .
they &apos;ll bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; <unk> &quot; is rooted in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential <unk> .
again , what potential do we want to use ?
in the 1960s , in the u.k. , a case case was done in the u.k. , <unk> were transformed into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are divided by grades .
and the a student will get <unk> harder teachers , getting better teachers .
and then you &apos;ve got over a <unk> period of time with a &quot; sufficient &quot; note , &quot; they were told you were very clever , they were very clever , and after those three months , she really wrote <unk> .
and , of course , it breaks the heart to hear that the other thing the <unk> was said , they &apos;re only enough .
and then it was the same for the three months .
but only those who are still in school -- except for the students who had thrown out school .
so the key part of this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told you that are the <unk> and that the students are enough with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treat them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind that was broken , has no hope of hope , and he doesn &apos;t really have any hope of it missing our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> capacity of imagination .
but if we can create the human mind on hope to continue to find themselves , and other people around them are beautiful to find , curious and <unk> , then we put our forces really positive .
if a mind has these qualities , we can actually create a new reality and a new <unk> .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet named <unk> in the 14th century , and my friend jacques <unk> tells me . and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god of the name , not the god of the <unk> , not the god of the <unk> . &quot;
come with dance . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right ?
suppose i said that , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory might have -- more precise , more and faster .
or do you want to be more <unk> , more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer at good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are already around to more creativity .
which guess what would you like most ?
what would you like to have to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to make a good memory ?
a couple more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like a doctor .
if you could just have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is all this a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor &apos;s view .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , just wrote a paper , &quot; nothing in biology does not make sense in biology , except in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who accept the proof of biological evolution would be a very good time to turn your <unk> out , take your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you permission , and you might give them a look at kathryn <unk> &apos; book , which is about being wrong , because there &apos;s no sense of it .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other <unk> , or is it to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i have put a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the <unk> on the top of these branches have been success : they have survived it ; it has survived its ability to fitness and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branch from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , there was 20 or 25 different kinds of <unk> of hominids .
some have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but in fact , the most fundamental mechanisms are our cells quite equal to our cells .
is it clear that we can use it , and we can use the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human brain , which is used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> of what comes out of the pancreas .
and when we &apos;re talking about bacteria , is aware that each of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads to the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think , if antonio damasio for your sense of self , think about the bacteria ?
and our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that they could only have without effort to do any effort .
it &apos;s a really easier way of bacteria , with occasional <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , forced to make a push .
but otherwise they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as it matters for your life .
you help them nutrients from digestion nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come to the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
or are we going to become something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back into the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , perhaps three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first <unk> organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago , and then the human species , and then a billion years .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , the life on earth is only in the ground , only in the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , like a single <unk> , and the human life .
we were .
and this also represents the <unk> of this speech , so i hope that i would hope it would like you .
now , when i was a college student at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love in the power of evolution , and i posed something very fundamental : in most of the most people &apos;s existence in <unk> organisms , each cell is sharing , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue in both <unk> .
but at the time , when organisms showed up , things began to change .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that &apos;s going to be <unk> with the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of the death of the death of our body would happen in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s got to my increase doubt .
i &apos;ve come to see the feelings of george burns in las vegas his show in the &apos; 90s in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautifully <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
and i came to the realization that i was a doctor that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to hold healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
i wanted us to run a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the relationship of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , they &apos;re and i developed like <unk> rockets to send the genetic waste into the next stage of the orbit , to go to the sea .
i think we &apos;re all going to think of a mood , the woody allen of the way to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i want to achieve by going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria there that are <unk> , and by making the hot steam survive , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum cook , they &apos;ve managed to do a <unk> environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean , if we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and most of all how we &apos;re going to get into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for this would be that we &apos;ve managed to get a lot of genes , who had otherwise been to get a lot of genes that had been <unk> and made from the population .
and second , we think , as a species , we have a environment that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander around and we mix up so much that you can &apos;t tell , that isolation is necessary , for evolution , in terms of <unk> .
one second possibility is that it &apos;s an evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed from the forces of nature .
and the argument , here &apos;s the wheels of evolution , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far of the isolation we are on , when we &apos;re on a distant planet , it will be insulation and the changes of the environment , evolution could produce in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , amazing and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just , of course , is led to , but led to us as <unk> in the decisions we do .
well , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible to do that ?
well , let &apos;s look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of their child , but to make the genetic adaptations , to cure the disease and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or eliminate your risk of risk or strokes ?
would you not want to do these changes in your genes ?
if we go back , these kinds of changes will be possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can take a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be the reality that there will be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering department engineering prize prize prize prize prize prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who developed the natural process of the natural process of evolution , to lead faster to <unk> proteins in an efficient way -- which is an efficient way -- which is direct arnold evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the <unk> scientist , the scientist was awarded to his research in which he took an adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation manipulation , that cell corresponds to a pluripotent stem cell and potentially able to return to a level of cell in your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that makes the human insulin can make viruses that are not only to protect themselves in front of themselves , but can serve the immunity to other viruses .
whether they believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang of vaccine that &apos;s been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a good thing that tobacco comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and the future is going to be much more possible .
now , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and <unk> or the fresh <unk> egg in order to give your kids a better chance for a <unk> life -- eliminating the diabetes , the risk of cancer to reduce risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science can enable the changes to prevent disease , could also enable us to adopt <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why do not have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you &apos;re going to expand the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these will be <unk> .
and if we are at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires maybe 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that have their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be around .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better than more successful , more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose to selectively have different attributes that we want to do for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society forms and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to face .
and the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make this decisions ?
it might be in good like in evil , and before you think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now , a portable robot , which gives you <unk> skills , or another , the <unk> of it , helps to stand up and go .
so at berkeley <unk> , we call these robots .
they &apos;re not different than something that you put in the morning and gives you an extra strength and get to increase your speed and help them keep your balance , for example .
this is actually the real <unk> of human and machine .
but not only that -- with that -- and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers on average , which is about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the demand that they should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we were going to take this challenge and create a <unk> that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or the human human <unk> <unk> .
soldier : i can wear 200 pounds of the <unk> terrain , for many hours .
so flexible design enables it to be deeply on , based deep and <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and increase my strength and persistence .
we &apos;re as far as we have to introduce our <unk> to this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our look at the wheelchair users , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there &apos;s 68 million people in the world estimated in a wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s indeed a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injury in the <unk> of their lives -- &apos; 20s , 30s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s -- the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , the number of times .
and pretty much the only option -- if it goes to a <unk> , or for the other complications , is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been about 500 years since i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the field .
so let me introduce you now to <unk> , which is being carried by amanda <unk> , which had a <unk> suffered from the outcome 19 , which has to run that they couldn &apos;t run for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
its completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals that are <unk> on our <unk> , which is on its back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as their <unk> , which are moving forward in this fairly <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and any movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every <unk> hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have come to me since then to drive , to climb up , to climb , to climb , and driving the hands of the wheel .
but nothing was invented to me again , so far .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms for us to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all users , but for everyone .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m ceo of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get the poverty of poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> in a volunteer <unk> .
now , in our city , in the volunteers of volunteers in volunteers , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to be able to be able to do it .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers of <unk> , so i had a pretty good opportunity to go in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the <unk> <unk> and find out what our jobs would be .
and when i found the <unk> , he had a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which certainly had one of the worst days of their lives .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was sitting in the <unk> and barefoot under a screen out of a screen outside the rain , while her house was falling .
the other volunteer that was close to me -- let &apos;s call him <unk> luther -- had had to go to the <unk> and became asked to go into the house and save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was <unk> envy .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , which is now for the rest of his life that could tell people that he went into a <unk> house to save a living creature , only because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you need to go into the house .
you have to go to the top of the fire , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
now , not exactly what i hope to do , but i went up and up up up up up up the stairs , the hallway , the real &quot; <unk> , &quot; over that moment , they were just ready to get into the bedroom of a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i carried my prey back to the bottom , where i had <unk> my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our scores out of the outside to <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention than mine .
a couple of weeks later , a letter got a letter of the <unk> , where she &apos;s going to give you the brave use of saving her house .
and one of the most measurements of kindness : somebody even had a pair of shoes .
and now , in my profession , as well in my <unk> , as also in my <unk> , fireman is a witness of generosity and kindness at the big scale , but i also see the altruism and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i see myself in this room , and i see people who have either ever reached a <unk> success or in their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the lives of another , until you reach your first million .
if you give something to you , you &apos;ll give it .
you &apos;re going to use them in a <unk> , rooms in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day we &apos;re going to provide a chance to save the lives of a human , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so let &apos;s go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s secret .
a place where women lead the <unk> with sex &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- which is fun .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their <unk> .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our closest living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect <unk> in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
whereas chimpanzees are going to run large , fear of large , fear of <unk> , will lead the <unk> of women &apos;s females .
they really came up with that , because that leads to a very <unk> society , in the deadly violence has not been seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known to the primates .
they &apos;re living in the depths of <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re just to be able to access it .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent debate that has been required for decades and almost so many lives required for decades .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction are at risk .
<unk> and the decline of <unk> leads you to fill a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not safe to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with social partners , and rules so conflicts and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life &apos;s life consists of more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s a fundamental bond of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play expands creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity in behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobos , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> us .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique images out of the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think of <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin , &quot; it puts him on the eggs . &quot;
just i think it &apos;s more like it , right .
yeah !
so <unk> are distributed , both in bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> where you make new elements in the game -- like the testicles -- and also how the game is <unk> to trust as well -- while it &apos;s doing this .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take lots of forms that some calm down , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she &apos;s playing peaceful with water .
and i think just like you &apos;re going to play alone , and we &apos;re <unk> limitations of our inner worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact and interact , and the unexpected wiring that we form are the real ground of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> in the insights , the bonobos <unk> us in our past and present .
but they also also have a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to rising challenges , through greater creativity and energy increased cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to be successful in the world , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos , and people are alike , not in the teeth and claws alone .
now , if it doesn &apos;t seem appropriate , perhaps at the end of it .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s give this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re talking about creativity <unk> and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in the middle 1979 , the same day , at exactly the same moment , every <unk> a baby -- okay .
so two couples , every <unk> a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much of the <unk> , because if you think of all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
think about that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , this is a y <unk> , which hits the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , this is an x chromosome based on the x chromosome of the <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two hats .
in a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m a study of <unk> , and in this case , i study people with anatomy -- that means human body , animal body -- how they thought with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i &apos;ve carried in my work is the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say sometimes , as a impatient -- of people who are patients &apos; patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people , their gender -- so people who have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the kinds of type of things that are not about male or female standard .
in one case , you may have somebody with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> will be the <unk> that we all have <unk> and grow up .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are <unk> testosterone .
but because this individual are missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to it .
as a consequence , the body evolves more of the typical female course .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but most of the time it &apos;s grown up to puberty , and they grow their breasts , and they develop their breasts , but they &apos;re not going to get their period , until someone comes out there something different .
and you &apos;re doing a couple of tests and find out that it &apos;s instead of <unk> and uterus , in reality , and they &apos;re wearing a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person to actually the male for actually , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called <unk> .
they are in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> set of places that are <unk> hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical one -- most of the women like i actually talk about <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
and the result is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was exposed to a woman who was born with testicles , and has a <unk> .
so gender are really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across all the bandwidth .
another example : a couple of years ago , i got the phone call a man who was born as a boy , who was a boy , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he just found that he had <unk> and one uterus .
he had an extreme form of a natural form .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> were so active active , that they &apos;ve created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he &apos;s inside the <unk> that the doctors found out that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a form of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes develop something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children do with this type of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or identical twins , the surgeons are often adapted to the norm , not because of the physical health of the advantage .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often made different kinds of surgical surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that it &apos;s a certain anatomical expression with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman means to be a female identity , which is to be a black person , is supposedly , being an african anatomy in terms of its own story .
so we have this horrible <unk> idea .
and when we faced with a body , which is actually something very different , it confused us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture about <unk> .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , what you can imagine is how amazing it is when children are born , the two people are in a body .
where i had experienced most of the excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> last year whose gender were asked in berlin in berlin .
and a lot of journalists were calling me to the question : &quot; what &apos;s the test you &apos;re going to do , whether is <unk> <unk> female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
now , we know that gender gender are complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have to go line between male and female , or between male and <unk> and female and <unk> ; <unk> , we &apos;re the one that we say , of course .
so we have such a situation where we have the further our science rise , we have to say that these categories that we thought we &apos;ve thought very simple for both robust anatomical categories , which are much more powerful than we adopted .
and that &apos;s not just on gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which it turns out to be a much more complicated than our <unk> .
in our essays , we get into all kinds of <unk> areas .
so , for example , we push into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we &apos;re dependent on a few layers of forms ?
while we keep our science moving forward , we &apos;re increasingly moving into a <unk> where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that we have probably had too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the <unk> , in our today &apos;s culture , in our today &apos;s culture , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what is a body to humans , so that he has another right than fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been struggling to fight with the question , when somebody was dead .
you have kept a feather under the nose , and if they moved to it , they didn &apos;t bury them .
if she doesn &apos;t move more , you &apos;d buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we take people <unk> organs and want to put them in other people .
and as a result , we caught ourselves in the fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categories as well .
now you might think that the whole thing was about categories just like me to be happy .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , i &apos;m nervous .
to understand that these categories are actually much more insecure than we thought to me .
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking about democracy .
so , to tell you about this <unk> , i first have to go up first , that i &apos;m a big fan of founding founding .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i find that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in which what they did is that i &apos;m going to look at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on with the <unk> .
so the founding fathers were in my view of the original <unk> activists , that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a <unk> concept , and it was replacing it by another which is radical and beautiful and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our fathers remember the notion of monarchy , and the monarchy was taken on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had the political power , that political power should have , because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather , to the father , and so on .
and the founding fathers of this idea back and replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people were creating the same thing .
they <unk> the field field and decided that <unk> , the common common , are not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they made this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time also grew science .
if you look at the history of founding fathers &apos;s history , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , <unk> things , such as a supernatural concept of power , where the transmission of the <unk> is based on a very <unk> concept .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , she gave us a concept that was <unk> .
and that &apos;s how they have a wonderful way of the future civil rights .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years after years ?
for example , for example , the women , the <unk> <unk> , the concept of founding fathers , which says that anatomical anatomical is also more important than both the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we should have one uterus and <unk> , and we said , &quot; that we should have one uterus and <unk> , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women <unk> that successfully .
next , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> line of <unk> , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color , who professions themselves to <unk> common differences , again , successfully .
we see the same thing at the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the similarities , we need to be able to ask , why we sustain certain <unk> .
well , remember , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish , for example , a fish like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take far away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have been right to give their informed consent to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomical ones that make sense for me , and that &apos;s what we think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out which it &apos;s and why we keep them , and whether they make sense .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 at exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of <unk> , she &apos;s born on june 1 , in june .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to the <unk> , so he was born on a march of march .
just because of the fact that maria &apos;s three months of <unk> was born , they take all kinds of rights three months from <unk> -- the right to have sex , to choose the right to drink the right .
<unk> has to wait for all of this , not because it &apos;s a different biological age , just because of the birth of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other things about what their rights are .
<unk> , because it &apos;s male -- even though i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s <unk> -- because you think it &apos;s male , it can be moved in , which maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
now maria on , not in all states , can &apos;t see the same right , the <unk> in all states , and that &apos;s right to marry this .
henry can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today .
so we have these permanently <unk> categories in many ways in many ways and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is making such progress in the field of anatomy , that we do need to say that a democracy is based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , it feels as if science makes its own autonomously .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture looks like a sort of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at a point decided that to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and you get a woman to marry a woman means you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested in their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you at the beginning of the story .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in &quot; a dream of &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be able to say &quot; their skin color , but for the property of their character , &quot; and goes on anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you teach people because of their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to distribute rights to human beings , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden <unk> , probably more benefits than some people i know .
i &apos;d like to make sure that i &apos;m probably going to be some bright <unk> , which is more intelligent , more intelligent and mature decisions about their sexual relationships than some of these sexual relationships that i know .
so how do we <unk> the question of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality would be <unk> in the future -- could be made by an fmri ?
do we really want to go into that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leaders to make sense of the questions of democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , for example , in iran &apos;s case , where a man who &apos;s drawn to other men , is to be punished with the death with the death , unless he &apos;s ready to participate in a <unk> , where he &apos;s going to stay alive .
and we don &apos;t exist in that way .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a couple of years ago , who had a few identical twins with themselves to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i went to him with him , and asked why he made these surgeries -- they were high surgery -- he was his answer that in his country , these kids would be treated very badly , and so he had to do it .
and i answered , &quot; well , you have political asylum , instead of separate a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states gives incredible ways to allow people to be that they are , without having to change the state will change .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be a leader .
well , just to close , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about how democracy might look like , or looked at it , if we had the mothers involved .
and i want to say something radical is something radical , and i think that there might be different ways of insights that are <unk> from different kinds of anatomy , <unk> when people are using a <unk> .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operating in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not any one , but in average , complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to people are very much more attention .
and so , if we think about this , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my favorite students who knew my interest in feminism -- looked at me as a feminist , so i &apos;m doing a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> stereotypes about gender , that &apos;s why feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so more i thought there could be something <unk> in feminism .
this is supposed to be called , there might be something , on average , on average , which is what female brains are different from male , which makes us care about social relationships and <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding founding fathers were extremely <unk> to find out how individuals were going to be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that when we &apos;re more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re not just protecting the concept , not just how to protect , but how we care about each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future , if we have to think about anatomy <unk> -- less to think about the individual bodies of identity , and think more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to make a people trying to make a <unk> connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to do a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find a kind of a chance to find a different <unk> , <unk> outfit , and photograph in the last time and blogging .
but i buy nothing new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment , and also that on my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people , my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look quite unique , and it makes a lot of personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all answers , i feel like i won .
i come back on my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve been packing for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;ll just show you exactly what i brought .
i &apos;ve got seven pair of <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly one week are all i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet that i would have any other thing , what i might want to wear , would find if i came up after palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me , as the woman who walk around here at ted in her underwear in your underwear -- i mean , i &apos;ve found a couple of things .
and i want to show you my <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to share with you some of the lessons that i &apos;m doing , whether you believe it or not , from these <unk> , have learned anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including a jacket , has 55 to me , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s impossible to be impossible to be <unk> , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life to try and be myself and adapt to the same time .
just be who they are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , they &apos;re also going to estimate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that i would be like i &apos;d be like &apos; dress &apos; games or i remember her .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you look at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they don &apos;t look good in something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that briefly for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to do everything that we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit to everything .
and finally , saturday : one , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world a little bit about one , without having to say a word .
and it always occurred to me and over again , when people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home after brooklyn , i &apos;ll donate all of that again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to give these things emotionally <unk> , because right around the corner , it &apos;s always going to give up another crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just wait for me if i love a little bit of love in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve got something i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as <unk> , as flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally in italian , and every boy grows in italy with this picture in the room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that the formula has something very interesting in the past decades .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula a race , then they took your budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won .
now , now , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something like this -- something that has a car in real time , a couple of thousands of sensors that have information to pass on the car , and then use things to change this car in real time and change things in real time .
this would call them , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> begin to appear in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be the computer in free .
and as a computer in the free , they start to react in other ways , and they &apos;re perceived and driven .
if we &apos;re going to go cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
and by the way , i just want to mention that cities only are two percent of the earth &apos;s land land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of that perceive and power in the objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that &apos;s paola antonelli for moma later in the year , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there , and it &apos;s a sensor , a sensor , and a <unk> .
and that changes the interaction that we have people out with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo formed his moses , she says he took the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- actually , she still can see a little place <unk> -- and he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins for the first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , to perceive our environment and power our environment .
so let &apos;s start with that sense .
now the first project i &apos;d like to show you is in the truth of our labs .
it was born four and a half years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done is actually actually a new kind of network of using the network that was used in the world -- this is a <unk> -- and <unk> and <unk> information from this network that &apos;s all works to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the <unk> won the <unk> .
some of you will remember it was in the course of france , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and anyway , in italy at the end .
now , look at what happened that day , only when the activity has happened in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , in front of the game .
you see the timeline .
in the early days , people here and there , the phone calls and are moving .
the game begins -- silence .
france does a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
<unk> , people make a little call , go to toilet .
second <unk> . end up .
first extension , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , that night , everyone went to the center to celebrate .
and they saw the great rash .
the next day , everyone went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then all went down .
you can see the picture of the place <unk> <unk> , where since the roman time , the people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and they see the key drivers at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way , in a way we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
very quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but things that we use and consume .
well , today we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that are a mac computer , how they came together .
but we know a little bit about where things go .
so , in this project , we designed some little markers to track the garbage while it &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with a couple of volunteers who helped us , a little more than a year ago , helped to tag the things that they can see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away all the time .
and then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the trash and started track him .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve just got .
seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can actually do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s what a lot of things happen to happen and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away is not just disappearing , it &apos;s still anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we show that to people , then we can drive change change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
so my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could give you a lot more about the vision and many other wonderful things you can do with perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we were in the beginning , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition to use in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
and one of the ideas that have been <unk> in a <unk> <unk> is , imagine these tubes , and the valves , <unk> , valves , open and close .
they &apos;re doing something like a <unk> with <unk> water .
when those fall fall fall , you can write patterns , you can write patterns , images to map text .
and you can approach it , and he &apos;s going to open up to let them be able to see them in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor <unk> .
it was very like him .
and we got the assignment to design a building at the entrance to the expo .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and make it in .
the roof was covered as well .
and if it &apos;s windy if you want to reduce the syringes , you can actually leave the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture is going to be like in this case , you know , these days , when you get the roof off , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that the architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you look at me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , the water &apos;s not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what one night happened than all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was more more fun in that night .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make you , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump jumping without getting wet .
and that was , really exciting for us , because as architects , engineers , as designers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interacting with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and projection projection .
and this is what makes us think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine these <unk> could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter that fly through the air , and each of you with a little <unk> of light with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw earlier , moving with others , completely in sync .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or an ad , like this -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is , not the position of <unk> .
they can play with different ways .
imagine that you could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud from <unk> , where you can walk through and move through them , which you can look at from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , which is <unk> to form like a <unk> v .
when you turn the light on it , it looks like this , so just as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person is being controlled .
it could have every single piece of impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or so forth .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater , in new york and <unk> in milan -- we took its movements in 3d order to use it as momentum for the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can understand the whole movement .
they can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have <unk> , you can play with it , and with color motion and playing <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a possible impulse to use the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that , again , we &apos;re putting people involved in doing something and change the environment -- almost as something we call it to be a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everyone can give a little donation for a <unk> .
i think the remarkable thing that happened over the last few years , the last few decades is that we changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized all , knowledge , and it makes it available through the internet .
now , for the first time , we can -- and the campaign obama showed that -- we can change from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to give us the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we shift from the digital world .
so the idea is that we actually include the people in which they are collectively , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud from <unk> , in the same way as a cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud from <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical device in london , but it &apos;s covered in <unk> .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , the most important moments of <unk> 2012 , and also sharing it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to , like london &apos;s new <unk> .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
i mean , as an artist , the relationship is very important .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
i was in awe .
my heart hit , i was <unk> , while i was trying to grab what was standing in front of me .
the <unk> around me was almost 60 feet out of the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year by year .
<unk> are born a calf of a glacier or a calf out of <unk> .
each iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact in distinct ways with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and they &apos;re <unk> until the bitter end , while others don &apos;t go and make it more <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think that they &apos;re very isolated , separate and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far from it .
as a iceberg melting in the iceberg , i put his <unk> atmosphere .
as the iceberg melts , it <unk> <unk> drinking water , which feeds a lot of forms .
i &apos;m going to take my footage from this <unk> , as i would make portraits of my ancestors in the mind that they exist in those individual moments in this individual moments and never again .
it &apos;s not a death when it melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> of your <unk> along the life cycle .
a part of the ice in the morning , which i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you , you show a iceberg that i have <unk> in greenland in greenland .
very rarely can actually witness a <unk> iceberg .
so here you see it .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat moves to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , it shows you another side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really very blessed by doing some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever been working on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leaders of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of this .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up with him .
i have a company to do the design and animations , so this graffiti is necessarily a complex part of what we admire and paying attention .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll be giving you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back to him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , this is not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be able to communicate through these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about the <unk> and you &apos;ve heard a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
people are not available to normal people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &apos; butterfly and <unk> ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along .
i said , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need for just a check , and i put a check that i didn &apos;t know the <unk> of how i was going to <unk> him .
and i kept committing me up and ask about his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is like : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;ll get a device and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who carries all of that still in it , can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked a couple months later at a conference .
i met these guys from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project any light on any surface and then to put light on them , which is just registered with the negative space .
so they move around and make <unk> like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the <unk> , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and finally , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife and ate her by all , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology , where you can use your eyes to control things , then we should be able to make a way to control things , that would be great . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first of all , we were allowed to feed the doors to the doors , and actually have a machine to get a device to communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids , and i went to the garage , and those hacker and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid that we were beautiful to do that , and that we were <unk> and all the pictures on the walls were <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to <unk> in venice , my children were involved , and we created this one .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of venice , a little bit of <unk> and a few things out of the local hardware and a couple of things .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they put them on a <unk> , and now we &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code for free , the software can be to download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely freely from limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital too .
every <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this <unk> before the great revelation .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony drew the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s seeing his life support system .
we tended to have his bed to see it outside .
we set up a projector against a wall of the <unk> hospital before the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
we also had to <unk> in the parking lot , so we felt as a part of the <unk> .
and at the end , he would send us an email with the question , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something like that .
i feel that i was pushed under water , and i finally got one up to the bottom and up my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that &apos;s keeping us , and we &apos;re always going to develop .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
and someone who has such a different potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re doing to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us , and then , in december , we &apos;ve been honored to be honored by the 50 great invention in 2010 , which was really great .
and the <unk> of this is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s this april , <unk> <unk> in the inner city of los angeles , is going to be an exhibition called the way of los angeles . &quot;
and there will be pretty much the toughest representatives of the <unk> there -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> will be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- they &apos;re all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had something to do with <unk> , but i just captured something , and i &apos;ve just got surrounded me with amazing people , so we could do something together .
and this question should each one of you would ask , and every single day where you noticed something that &apos;s got to do that . if not now , when does ? and if not i , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably most of america &apos;s mostly <unk> .
and i tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody &apos;s ever elected a farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;re left it somewhere .
you go to the block and it was a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has done it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to share with you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s in <unk> , ohio where i was the <unk> .
i was the one that was beaten in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by taking me the toilet in the <unk> .
i did it secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and i found a lover in the &apos; 80s , and i found it important in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , a woman <unk> , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned to know each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know you have in the meantime .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to go up please . &quot;
well the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we laughed , and we knew that you had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we went around them , and we gave up their family , because it was needed .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted me to learn to know as adults , they turned into a box full of ash , and put into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of which i talked about .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs all the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this has been mentioned here today .
he needs the same way -- it would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
so , imagine a great explosion , while you rise to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a power engine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
that sounds <unk> .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
and so i looked at them the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already been <unk> , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes happened later three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set out the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns off the engines .
imagine a <unk> plane .
and then he said three words -- the most famous words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> for the ground . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i was able to see it in her eyes , i was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned from this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people that i wanted to do a hand , and not indeed , all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experiences that i wanted to do and never did .
while i was thinking about this , i noticed a saying that is : &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is , and the person is there , i open it up .
i never want to change something more in life .
and this urgency , this urgency , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> the george washington bridge , pretty much <unk> -- and i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to get better to become better in everything i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i gave in my ego .
and i <unk> the time that i wasted for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t give me two years to my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the internal o &apos;clock <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ...
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
while we &apos;re <unk> , i had this feeling , man , not to die .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;re preparing for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really , really in one thought , is that i just want one thing .
i wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after that , i visited a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent .
not yet .
and i <unk> , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
i realized at the time when i was connected to the dots that it &apos;s about a great father in life .
more than everything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i &apos;ve seen miracles on this day not to die .
i received another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live and live .
my call to all of you that fly today is : imagine the same thing in your flight -- please not -- but imagine ; and how would you change ?
what would you do that they put it in , because you think they would be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are the best parents that they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post in the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we can do the systems to control the <unk> and the valves , then we can actually create a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can make it that an effective <unk> on a laptop can be used by a <unk> box to <unk> this gray box , then we are in business .
and that &apos;s the planning with <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will <unk> into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started our research on <unk> six months ago , it was completely unknown to what the purpose of this <unk> was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , very complicated , which is the <unk> part , he made a <unk> bit of <unk> <unk> error .
and it seemed <unk> , with these gray boxes , that <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment with <unk> , and we studied this construct .
and then something funny happened .
<unk> behavior was like a <unk> that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> off , but didn &apos;t eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we experimented with various kinds of cheese , i went to the fact that this is an <unk> attack .
complete on a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> activity active by the gray box when a special configuration has been discovered , even if the special program that &apos;s trying to infect it on this goal .
and if you don &apos;t , then doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , this really got my interest , and we started working with this , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , we say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> we have the <unk> code , and we found that it &apos;s <unk> in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were highly designed , from people who obviously had all <unk> information .
they knew all the bits and <unk> that they had to attack .
you probably knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve noticed that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking for as first was <unk> <unk> , because we know what that do .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> , trying to connect them to the real world -- potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these targets that we could prove or disprove it .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to be a viable goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because there were most infections that were reported there .
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand targets .
basically , it &apos;s going beyond that <unk> nuclear power and <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for <unk> and power plants . &quot;
and i called them , and you know , you know , to compare her knowledge to compare what we &apos;ve found in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> to the <unk> .
the rotor is this moving part of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this <unk> , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor of rotor , and then even to explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack actually was to let it happen slowly and dramatically happen -- obviously in trying to <unk> <unk> and so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it quickly .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse by which we looked at very closely and <unk> .
so , for example , the number that &apos;s going to be <unk> is out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to <unk> scientific literature on how these <unk> were built in <unk> , and found that they &apos;re <unk> in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense of that .
and it &apos;s got better .
these <unk> in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for what we were studying here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , not just like that .
these results were reached through several weeks .
and often we just ran into a <unk> , and we had to <unk> ourselves .
anyway , what we found is that both of the digital warheads are in reality on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and the rotors and slowed them down , and the big <unk> comes up with six <unk> in interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in the big and whole , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about that other goals could be made by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- made me <unk> .
it &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see it on top of it .
now , what this thing does is that it &apos;s making the flow of sensors -- so , for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s available to the <unk> of that , which is still in the <unk> of the data , going on .
and in fact , this false <unk> data is taken from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> is fed by <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea here is obviously not just the <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more violent .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , in a power station , for example , if the big <unk> gets too fast , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so this is where we need digital <unk> .
and if you are at risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and it &apos;s not the <unk> , nor the <unk> .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work right now -- in a power station or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we &apos;ve seen it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they lie in the united states in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the most powerful environments .
we need to put the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been reported very much of it that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> behind it .
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
in my mind , it &apos;s been involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , luckily .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you that you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years trying to place me in situations that normally are very difficult and at the same time somehow dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i &apos;ve worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the greatest part of my career that seems to be exposed to <unk> situations , and all of that , all of the attempt to study this is that it &apos;s compelling and interesting , and hopefully , in a way , which you make for the audience fun and accessible .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew that i would make something a little different .
some of you may have heard about it a couple of weeks ago i took an ad on ebay .
i sent out a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , they got a unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson is going to let me buy that , that chris anderson is going to let me buy -- a lot of content , and not a lot of content on what the subject would be .
so what you &apos;ve got was this : my name here was : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and you can finally give you the content for the ears , especially if i give your company stupid .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone into some pretty terrible situations over the years , but i couldn &apos;t get ready to do anything that was so hard to me to go on something so hard and dangerous like this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea of a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that everything , from up to the bottom up to the end , from the beginning to the end , is totally <unk> -- from the <unk> , which you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be connected to the film in eternity .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- this is what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to emphasis on .
it was , &quot; eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x as a <unk> , but we &apos;re sure we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
so we may sell a shoe , and it will be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car that they &apos;ve ever driven is from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a awareness of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are a part of life , actually , to get them to finance the movie ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to be able to do that , to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how this will develop ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth it in any case , some really known brands .
you know , if the movie comes out , we might see like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is probably most likely &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing about the film or a hard thing about me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about the brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people that they have to do .
there are some places we can turn to .
make the camera .
i thought , &quot; do the camera , &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s actually meant , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so disappeared , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to present your product as many people as possible as possible , as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media and the <unk> media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting <unk> that makes the masses .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and this was the following .
actually , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that would be no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re in transparency , you know , this is one of the first images that seems to appear .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> , right ; characterized by <unk> and access to information , especially the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a lot of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s going to be implemented , changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear <unk> -- like this strange bear that still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like these strange <unk> .
and she &apos;s also very risky .
what else is still risky ?
a whole dish cool <unk> food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me with the lie -- and there he is sitting and looked at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s just a company , a agency , who was ready to help us -- and that also because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i found that i had to deal with the <unk> and directly with my team to the companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i &apos;ve got friends who do great , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> as i do .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , say that the reason why their films are so successful at the bottom of the things that they have .
and then my friends , say , do the little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how are we going to see ban in the movie ?
always , when i do it , and whenever i open the <unk> , you can see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are they fresh enough for this interview ?
are you like that ? you &apos;re a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe they should be a bit of interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we &apos;re offering one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men and being equipped for women -- solid , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can answer all your questions and give them an equal version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we are as a brand <unk> .
so we have not as a budget like other brands .
so , you know -- you know , people in ban , you know -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
in which words would you describe ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you want to describe something about the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a difference , as opposed to &quot; fighting odor and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , fresh fresh , fresh fresh .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man in the street , which are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like , really , beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s <unk> on <unk> , except at the <unk> .
now , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style , which i have , is &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of <unk> and such stuff .
but normally i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry for this .
if dan would be a brand , he probably would probably be a classic mercedes-benz .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , is i would say , <unk> fly .
she 2 : partly a particularly part of hippie , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> across the country , globally .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the <unk> , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what to call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , helped discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for that , you could also help me .
you brought their pictures together , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that is associated with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live , the way you live , the work and so .
all of these things come and start from a place and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the context of thinking and feelings about yourself ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what <unk> are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , that &apos;s not you .
what else did they go through ?
that &apos;s not a fear . what kind of rollercoaster is you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there are lots of crazy things going on .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their <unk> two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan is a <unk> brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to do that -- and this is the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s actually a <unk> <unk> .
what else brands are like ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , wii mini by mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if anybody would ask them to describe their <unk> , your <unk> , how would you ?
you &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that brings your blood into <unk> ?
or are you more likely to have a <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , <unk> like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and agile , agile and agile , <unk> and agile , magical and <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
are it reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , safe , holy , <unk> , bases like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
over the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , the up and <unk> , and they said no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they don &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 <unk> who were willing to give up to that control with somebody to do business with someone as mindful and playful as i , and then finally , to tell stories that we don &apos;t usually have to tell -- stories that would usually never support a <unk> .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using <unk> to make the <unk> of the brain , both of advertising and movies .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> had been banned .
in the entire city for five years , for five years , there &apos;s no poster , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school districts , in which companies are able to make their way in impoverished schools , all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got to get the most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that they may not really be interested in their interests .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is that our view .
and what was that ? what does it succeed ?
now , there &apos;s the film at the <unk> film festival , we can look at this .
according to <unk> , the first thing in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- 900 million <unk> of this film .
it &apos;s actually just a period of two-thirds of two-thirds .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no television .
the film has not been <unk> .
there &apos;s not even online . no <unk> .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , where almost every <unk> that we talked about , would recommend their clients to make the fingers of it .
something that i &apos;m sure what i think is , when you push your chance to arrest the risks that are in these risks .
i think if you stop people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re getting your employees to avoid risk , you &apos;re prepared for a profit to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have a fear that you might have <unk> .
finally , in progress , we should welcome fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome to fear . they welcome the risk .
a big taste full of them , we &apos;re called the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever , is a little bit more honesty .
and that &apos;s what i said with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; welcome transparency , &quot; i &apos;m presenting to you transparency from my good friends of <unk> who paid $ <unk> to ebay .
big data will transform for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
<unk> presents : &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s going on with $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , put on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check at a high school in <unk> to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m talking about to do something with museums and art , and my <unk> , who &apos;s now , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums museums .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal vision is very simple with this slide and your access to access .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- but i didn &apos;t -- but i had no access to a museums , and that works .
and then when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working on google , i tried this desire to make art more accessible -- with technology .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration , and you &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look around at all these museums .
this is the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , <unk> , van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and happiness .
you want to orient your museum ?
open the card , and jump up with a click .
you &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just go . much fun .
find out .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
so i &apos;m in front of one of my <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum has given us the picture , click on it .
now , this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click here -- but i click now .
this is one of the images we captured with the so-called <unk> .
so , for example , this picture has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can get very easily and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go deep inside .
and so i started playing around and found that there is something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to get close , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat .
i did a little bit , talked with some known in the met , and actually , in fact , that &apos;s a game called <unk> , which is a goose beaten on a stick with a stick .
it seems to be very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to get really close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you a sense of view , i &apos;m out to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump to moma fast , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you don &apos;t want to see what van gogh created this masterpiece ?
you put in there . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite points in this image , until i really am .
this is <unk> , probably ever seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , which is called collections .
each of you , everybody -- whether rich or arm , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and make their own museum , and you can put out of all these images from all these images , you can put your own collection .
just simply , they go in there -- and i created this , which is the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put it all with notes , send your friends , and start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , the main thing , for me , is the main thing that there &apos;s all the wonderful things here .
it &apos;s not coming from the museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art , and it &apos;s <unk> online .
and this is the biggest question i &apos;ve been asking , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
you want to add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then half the right , the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you <unk> your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a lot of <unk> , which is at the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so forth .
they can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , in common with most of the <unk> <unk> that takes a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to perform experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things .
so we go out and play with it and look how it responds , and then we start developing our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can only be in a place at the same time .
i mean , it may sound strange that one thing at the same time is about two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they evolved .
i remember seeing a child playing on a <unk> .
he was another one , and it &apos;s not very good at it , and it fell constantly .
but i bet that he was playing a very valuable lesson with a very valuable lesson , which is that big things don &apos;t just leave you and they stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little weird particles .
and if you &apos;re playing with their particles , put all kinds of odd things -- like they &apos;re flying directly through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the small , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe them all the mundane objects around us .
it didn &apos;t like my intuition , and it may only be because i don &apos;t really often play with particles .
well , i &apos;ll play sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side has not liked it .
because when all the things made out of particles and all these particles are following the rules of quantum mechanics , then not to just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why this is not that way .
so i would feel better with the whole thing , if we could be able to show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made myself a few years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see , which was in <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece that i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s an image of the object .
here i &apos;ll expand something . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s like a springboard and it stands across the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours on all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool and getting this thing .
and this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m at the elevator alone , i &apos;ll do all kinds of weird things , but then i do all kinds of weird things , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
and so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just going to feel like this .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to be on them and the wind that seems to be over and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is <unk> , we had to <unk> out all the <unk> .
and we did that .
we turned the light off , put it into a vacuum , and they put it into a vacuum and <unk> it all until now , all the way around the elevator , the piece was free to behave like it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it was really strange .
instead of it , it just lies there , <unk> it . the way it was <unk> , like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little push , we could be able to vibrate at the same time and not vibrate -- something that &apos;s allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just telling you about is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms out of these atoms are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms move up and down .
just too powerful <unk> voices .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is in two different locations , which is the same piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
that was value for all this year in the clean room , because , check that , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece of metal is just like the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom at the same time can be in two different places , this piece of metal in two different places , why don &apos;t you do it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in several places , what would that feel like ?
how would you deal with how to deal with your body in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
and when we <unk> that light and <unk> the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator , in fact , are just <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected .
well , that &apos;s not really right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s like these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> to think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about it , where they want to live and work , they want to choose between at least one hand of different cities that all of you have in competition with new residents .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world , which is not even a single city that they would welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs them .
so we could do very easily with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now that sounds may be absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought of new cities .
but they just share the construction of apartments against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , do this ; the other half , but not yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what you &apos;re going to be about to avoid in these apartments and their environment to avoid any more so to avoid any more <unk> from <unk> .
so it turns out that it turns out to be very hard all of these extensions .
but you could go into a completely new place , and build a new building block , if the laws were going to support you and not <unk> it .
so i proposed that governments are creating new surfaces that have enough space for a city and give them a name : <unk> cities .
and then i found out later that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> are about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year every year , about 75,000 <unk> of their country , were <unk> in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could be doing to ensure that these people can stay in the country , and the same in honduras .
at this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we put a <unk> area of our country &apos;s surface , what if we just put them on a message , a part of the american embassy , and if people want to go to work under the canadian rules , and if people want to go to work under the canadian rules or the united states , what they would normally go to canada or america ?
in the summer of 2009 , honduras was suffering under a severe <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> was a turnaround in a shift whose program was so promised to innovate as well as <unk> .
he asked <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i was doing a talk at tedglobal .
so through improvement , test and studying consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of <unk> city to the fundamental elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have to disturb existing <unk> .
we pay new technologies big attention , but for the progress we need , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually the laws that help us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and again , it showed him <unk> .
they were called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s put this to the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than it costs .
and i &apos;ve been using this chart to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , and think of it in some cases , a space per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place when there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk turned into very simple form , which is that a <unk> city is a place that is the beginning of <unk> land , a <unk> , which defines the laws that exist there and not to decide either of these rules or not .
and so , i was asked by the president of honduras , who said that we have to come to the project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and i was being asked to keep sitting on the fourth and fifth january and fifth january january .
so i &apos;ve thought to another with facts , which is a chart like this , which has tried to make sure that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and that sketch is called the new airport that was built in <unk> .
it &apos;s got a surface of the airport alone .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of it if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite , all <unk> .
the face of the audience were very serious and alert .
the director of congress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the statement that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the government of the government in honduras would be on the aid of <unk> them , they could benefit from their <unk> , which they would have to support the laws for this charter , and it would be supporting that everybody can really be able to get the charter .
and the realization of president <unk> was that the confidence of the <unk> that i was thinking about , as a way of taking the foreign investors to get here and build this city for all parties in honduras for many years of fear and mistrust .
we went into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s just a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , on january 19th , you &apos;ve voted in congress for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> control that &apos;s in particular <unk> <unk> .
in a country that has a violent crisis behind himself , congress was elected to a voice to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved to be approved by congress .
february 17th , the second time , there was a voice to be approved to a voice .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and 24 of february , the delegation of about 30 <unk> traveled to the two places in the world that were most interested in , in the business of <unk> inside .
it &apos;s a place in south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban center that &apos;s built in south korea in south korea in south korea .
everything that you can see in this picture was built within four years , after it took four years to get the permits to get .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
it has already built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> , and they &apos;re already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that it &apos;s allowed to be participate , and it will also work on an external law .
a country has been offered to have his supreme court , as a dish for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even make funding with one .
and one thing as you know already , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many businesses that would like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all over the world , there are 700 million people who say they want them to live in a different place .
there &apos;s a million people there every year every year and migrate to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to work on work , sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to earn enough money to eat themselves and afford to eat .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes children who try to find their parents back in some cases , in some cases , in some cases , in some cases .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in honduras for a whole new city ?
or to build <unk> from these cities , or distributed hundreds across the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice of multiple cities , who are in competition with new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a poll for over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , the u.s. budget is a typical americans in a day .
and also , recently , a study was done with ceos in which they saw the ceo week .
and these scientists just did have documented the different topics of these ceo , and how much time they were spending decisions about these issues .
and they found that the average ceo &apos;s average ceo has been working on the week .
each of these topics were , of course , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of category meeting in an hour ?
how good do you think are you to cope with decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the greatest science of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , just your hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , if i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was at stanford university , i went to this very very <unk> store , at least at least when he was really exclusive .
it was a place called the <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and about 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually had to have been .
i loved it to go to this business , but at one point i asked myself , you know , what is it that you never do anything ?
here &apos;s the olive walking .
they had 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were locked into boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to visit the leader one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; this model is that you really provide people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists that came every day and they usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose our experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we set up a little <unk> right at the entrance to the <unk> .
we put six different flavors of <unk> or 24 different flavors of <unk> , and we put two things out of this , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would more people would stay standing and try <unk> ?
there are more people left when it was 24 percent , about 60 percent than if there were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what people would rather buy a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and by the people who stayed there when they were 24 percent , they actually bought a glass glass .
by the people who have stayed when there were six , well , we &apos;ve seen that 30 percent of them actually saw a glass of glass .
now , if you calculate it , they bought the people six times a glass of <unk> who they had six to the choice when they were 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to decide a glass of <unk> , it &apos;s probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> has affected us with very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial resources .
i &apos;m going to describe to you a study now that i was doing with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were watching the decisions for almost a million americans , from about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was if the number of <unk> that we could do , the <unk> plan , is the probability of what &apos;s going to be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was actually a context in fact .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans that gave people something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered that the more fund was that , in fact , participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans to give the two fund , had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as much as we want .
in the plans that <unk> nearly 60 fund , the <unk> came up now on about <unk> <unk> .
now it turns out that even if they were involved in <unk> , when there were more possibilities for choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who were trying to participate in , more than the more opportunities they were available , the more avoiding it <unk> and choose .
the more choices they were available , the more they were going to put their money down to their own money .
none of those extreme decisions , it belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend if we care about the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences for people to provide more and more choices .
they make the decision -- push it , even if it &apos;s against your own best interest .
they make more poorer decisions -- poorer financial and poorer medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide more for things that you &apos;re making yourself less comfortable , even if you make objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may be enjoying this huge shelves of <unk> , mustard and <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t be able to pull the comparison and boundaries , and in fact , something made out of the amazing offer .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in different ways and in different ways -- they can just apply in your business .
first of all , narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today , that less more .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they lose <unk> .
but in truth , we see it more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be willing to end up , and they &apos;re going to get rid of the <unk> possibilities , you know , there &apos;s a increase in sales , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an increase in <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble , the different head of head and <unk> species of 26 to 15 reduced it , they &apos;d get an increase in sales by 10 percent .
as the golden <unk> corporation , her 10 to <unk> <unk> <unk> , they experienced that profit at 87 percent <unk> -- a result of the two , the increase in the rise of cost , and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical walmart provides you today 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is the <unk> supermarket in the world today , and they give them just 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples that came up recently on the market , is about how to do the best choice , something that david <unk> is very strong in which david <unk> is a program that &apos;s going to be at harvard .
every single harvard employees now takes them on a <unk> part .
the ones that really want to make a choice , 20 fund are offered , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limit it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i get the employees question is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t <unk> them , they can &apos;t be able to do it . &quot;
now before we started at noon today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience , to offer a <unk> vacation on the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read them , and then i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
okay . anybody who is willing to take <unk> &apos;s offer .
all that ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more of it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ll have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s objective , for the first time , had more information than the second time , but i would get to guess that they felt it in the second time .
because the images made it real for you .
what i &apos;m going to get to the second technology is that helps you to deal with the problem of food technology , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding the people in order to understand the difference between ways , understanding what consequences are associated with the individuals , and that will have to feel vivid and specific .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more if they use a <unk> or a card card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you create it , it &apos;s a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we have made in a study that i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- employees that have all been working for <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed her participation for their <unk> .
and during that meeting , we &apos;ve got these meeting just as she was always , only we added a little bit .
and the little thing that we have to do , was that we asked people just to think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or an increase in the amount that they were willing to pay for the <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can do better with more categories than more choices .
here &apos;s , for example , a study that we did in a <unk> .
it turns out that it turns out , it turns out , in the northeast area , and down in the northeast area , the number between magazines to <unk> different types of magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and you &apos;re going to show you 400 magazines , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and they think that in 20 categories , you think i gave them more choices and give you a better <unk> , and i have given them to give you the 400 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called <unk> .
if you think that the left display is <unk> , and the display on your jazz is , you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , you &apos;re clapping in clap .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something about the <unk> , not to provide the choice .
and the problem is often , if you look at the long list of all this fund .
who want you to inform ?
my fourth technology : premise of complexity .
it turns out that we can handle more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s have a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , which gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car itself .
you have to make 62 decisions to create their car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that you provide per choice .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of decisions .
half of the clients will go from the many possibilities , 56 <unk> at the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of customers are going from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
it &apos;s how interested you .
if you &apos;re constantly using the power of choice , which means they &apos;re being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what you &apos;re finding is that the people who are going to go from the very low <unk> , they &apos;re always going to choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
let &apos;s go from the little choices to the many , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order of changing the order of this information .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m going to go .
even though , even though they choose the gears , i don &apos;t have anything about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still keeping me to pick it to it .
and i also put myself in excitement about the big product that i &apos;m doing , and that &apos;s how i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be with interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve been telling you about four techniques that <unk> the problem of <unk> -- just -- they &apos;re going to get rid of the world alternatives -- <unk> -- make it real ; we can deal better with more categories , less opportunities ; we can deal better on complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m describing to you today is to help you help to help them -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for the people they provide .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re on a <unk> .
and the more we pick up selective picky , the better we will be able to practice the art of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . professionally , for a long time .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , then why it &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be star -- celebrities , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed like infinitely difficult .
but <unk> has enabled that we can all , or all our creative activities are <unk> famous in part of the culture of our world .
each one of you could be famous about the internet to next saturday .
but at youtube , there are more than 48 hours of video a minute .
again , just a tiny percentage ever will ever look and looked at thousands of times , and so the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , let &apos;s go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he photographed before his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million times seen .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video had been popular by the first summer .
in fact , <unk> didn &apos;t want to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do that , if you say , if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually on january already .
what happened here ?
that &apos;s where jimmy came up .
jimmy <unk> : the tweet that the video ended up on the end of the time .
because <unk> as jimmy <unk> shows us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> get down on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . she didn &apos;t think that we would lead these conversation without talking about this video .
rebecca <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looked at nearly 200 million this year .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; double <unk> , &quot; it seems to be none of them .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know : these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> started , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. banks from the <unk> science theater was one of the first people who made a joke about it .
it &apos;s important that an individual or a group of <unk> took up a point of view with a big audience , and <unk> the process .
and then , this community was formed by people who shared this big <unk> , and started talking about it and kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of stuff out .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single week .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is becoming part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or make something new .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year it became almost 50 million times .
and if you keep it crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s going to be seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
the important thing is , the creativity , which is in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there were there .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> shot from the ground that made it from a stupid joke that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure from something , we &apos;re doing .
who would have changed everything ?
who would have predicted &quot; double black or <unk> black or &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
what did they do to write in terms of something like that ?
in a world where every minute of video is uploaded to two days , it can only be really unexpected and unexpected <unk> as i mentioned .
i &apos;m going to admit , i wasn &apos;t really interested in a friend , and i said to myself , i want to look at this great video about a guy who &apos;s in new york to bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i wasn &apos;t going to be on the <unk> , but often there &apos;s disability that &apos;s not going to drive on the <unk> .
because this is completely surprising and humorous , casey has got fun fun idea , and his argument looked at five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and all of that leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and in the audience .
as i said , one of the currently largest stars -- justin bieber , he started from youtube .
nobody has to give up your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling about as owners of our culture .
and these are not the properties of the old media , and they &apos;re also not going to get into the media from today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i sit across the connectedness between three generations , and as the amazing strength of this connectedness is a four year-old girl in the life of a four-year-old girl , when she was sitting over 30 years old with her little sister , and she was sitting in a little sister with her little girl , and her mother , five days , and her grandmother , five days , that lives in a small girl , and it &apos;s going to talk to you today ?
the story isn &apos;t over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still composed .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his work .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life whose whole life was held together by unity and freedom of his home .
think about it in <unk> &apos;s <unk> in <unk> , as he has to say that his life has been a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , <unk> .
he went back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget life .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was not trying to <unk> us , but it &apos;s gone .
the next <unk> show shows like a boat in the early <unk> quietly <unk> .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for her life , she had a task : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that you could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat to the lake , as <unk> .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
they had the greatest fear of pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> .
in fact , there would be my sister , and i would have my sister and i had to drink my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- and so there &apos;s a continuous <unk> of the engine , the clapping of each of the wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came up many times , but the <unk> of the men left on our boat , or on the <unk> of the motors that didn &apos;t want to go .
but i remember the lights on the <unk> coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first <unk> , which one of the men on the platform was on .
no apple ever tasted like that again .
after three months in the refugee camp , we were in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations who together build together a new life .
we went down in <unk> , and one of the senior <unk> suburb , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike <unk> <unk> , whose existence was totally unknown to me , there was no <unk> .
the smells of <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> had been shared between people who had one thing together : they started new .
my mother was working on farms , then on one assembly line in a <unk> , six days , <unk> layers .
they somehow managed to find out the time , english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and i was put in more training in education for english and math , whatever we have to give , and mostly the new things that came from the second hand .
two few <unk> for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
it &apos;s a <unk> to the <unk> , because it had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and there and there , &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
how ?
something <unk> in me .
and there was one meeting to the reconciliation and quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other of our day , and they heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their <unk> came to me so i could do it .
she opened a <unk> , and then a <unk> and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsor were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one i was the classic asian student , the <unk> demands of himself .
in the other , i was involved in insecure lives of the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the insulation .
but that &apos;s how many received help .
and because of this aid , i was <unk> as a boy in the last year of <unk> <unk> .
and i was <unk> from one to the next <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le <unk> from <unk> , was now tan le , refugee and social activist that had never heard of places that she &apos;d never heard of , and in homes that she could never have imagined .
i &apos;m not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into a routine and the comfort of the life of an unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who told each of her days as <unk> as for 20 years , they were telling each other day , and <unk> each other , and we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old at that time when we had climbed the boat .
no , no way .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and unless you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized that i could not present myself with a career in america .
there must be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , <unk> in the picture -- and not just all right , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of <unk> .
because there can be so easy to collapse to collapse in the horizons , so it can mean that you &apos;re so easily accepted the assumptions .
now , i &apos;ve gone to know enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as you &apos;re doing it .
opportunities that were not allowed to be , has been encouraged explicitly .
there was a energy , an <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my feeling .
and i collected a little team of people around me , which is not a <unk> challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of one day , i was cooking a giant pot of soup that we shared .
we worked up until night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few brilliant with this , and we managed to get the breakthrough .
i made the decision to draw in the u.s.
after just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
and before i talk to the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time in the <unk> of the social norm , and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died soon after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
in 17 , she became the second woman in english whose mother was proposed .
without support of her husband , she was worried for a <unk> by <unk> him and <unk> in her own case , and a greater <unk> than she won .
&quot; is not , &quot; turned out as <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and i saw them on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat in the coffin .
we told their stories , and we told her that we were still at her .
at midnight , the monk came and said he must close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of it is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they hold it tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t get stuck . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through women .
and you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can see that the men who might have come in our lives , would have come to us .
it would have been easy .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yes , i was afraid , <unk> , ease of <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , and you know , the courageous every wave of <unk> , the <unk> , continuous <unk> of the engine , the vast horizon , who doesn &apos;t have anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it certainly could be <unk> , i would do it .
and also , mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or five row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
nevertheless , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , was at age 15 .
i put together with my previous predilection for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because the camera was actually going to be in planning .
and if you put a picture with a camera , the process ends when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about the photography of being in the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the trigger will return .
photographs like this : a construction site along a much <unk> street .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and <unk> is still a realistic level .
or photographs like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i want to make it look like you can have it , in a picture .
so photographs , where you have to think about a brief moment to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea that &apos;s really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together , to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
so we &apos;ve got three perfect simulation of the physical objects that we all relate to in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , combined with something , you can create something that is still three-dimensional , as if it could be .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brains are not quite easy to make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really just to combine different realities .
so the things that make a realistic picture , i think it &apos;s the things that we &apos;re not thinking about , the things around us in our everyday life .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to do , to achieve a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
now , combine something like this .
so the first rule is that computers should have the same perspective .
secondly , each other should have the same <unk> .
and these two pictures meet these two requirements -- from the same altitude , shot the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s because it &apos;s impossible to distinguish where the individual images start and end by connecting them seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to tell you how the photograph was actually composed .
so by making color , contrast and contrast in the edge of these individual images , photographic imperfections , like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we <unk> the boundaries between the different images and as a single photograph , although a single photograph can actually contain hundreds of layers .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom line is manipulated .
but this picture is completely completely composed , from photographs of different places .
personally , i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to try and find the different places for the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
that was from a different place .
this was a quarry from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house on the island of red <unk> to let it look like swedish .
so , to reach a more expensive outcome , it &apos;s looking for me to planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of very well planned .
and when you make good shots , the result can be quite beautiful , and it &apos;s pretty realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that &apos;s limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced at <unk> was to go a <unk> .
this is not particularly scientific -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . this is a very simple thing .
she has a button . it &apos;s from .
and every morning i jump on it .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
i have my job with 95 pounds of them .
it just works very simple : every time i get on the scale , then you send my data on google health .
and it &apos;s where you &apos;re going to <unk> from my <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and not just at the moment that i need <unk> , or that &apos;s what i need to do , but with a glimpse into the past .
there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i have over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump to my <unk> , and people talk to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; to lunch a little lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it could be used to smoking patients .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and bring them to play some kind of game in common to control their health better .
the next week , it comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give you this little <unk> of an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to send him to their doctor and to share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come into play , and they can &apos;t just take control of the control , the captain on their own ship , but we can also help our health care in the face of the challenges that are in front of us , and the <unk> of healthcare , twice .
do they do ways that are easy to use and start hug with this to hug patients in the team .
and that &apos;s what they can do with these methods , but also through <unk> .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all atms are around <unk> .
we know another where a gas stations are .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
but where are the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving <unk> was to find in that moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we set up a website , and we asked a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with you where he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 days have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , extended reality , to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you also have <unk> to find the next <unk> , saving life .
and before today , we don &apos;t just want to do this as a <unk> , which is what the product is called , but as a <unk> .
and we want to get this to a global scale .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like <unk> , to crowdsource these <unk> all over the world .
and if you &apos;re on holiday and someone is going on , it &apos;s your own blood , or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world are helping us to help us with these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or a technician , for example , to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its place .
please help us , and try to improve the health , not just to improve , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants us to make the environment by making it ...
it &apos;s the <unk> to be given .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may be charged with it .
well , we can just skip this -- i &apos;m going to just skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to take stars in technology and to get out a year break , and working in an environment , which is so much of what they really hate , we &apos;ve got them working in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like <unk> .
we choose a few fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them into <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is show what technology is possible today .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking after a date , but what he really looks like , is someone who <unk> him , when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at <unk> when it &apos;s a meter of snow .
how did he come to look for help ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston with the &quot; code for america . &quot;
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> <unk> .
and they discovered that the city never <unk> this fire hydrant .
but one particular fellow , a guy named erik <unk> , he noticed another thing , and that was that people were <unk> the sidewalks of sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do good developers , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you get to <unk> him , if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that fellows wrote in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other <unk> .
it &apos;s expanding rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , not for snow , but to keep the citizens <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the <unk> <unk> .
and chicago , they &apos;re just introduced to the people who <unk> the <unk> .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and she very very common , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know it &apos;s not normally going on .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that was working on a project last year in boston for three people and a half months .
it was about a method to find out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we were told later that if it would go over the regular canals , it would have taken it over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
now there &apos;s a project in the california law , which cost the taxpayer two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from <unk> , a kind of shot on the institution of the government .
it shows how government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think she should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly to this app is that it represents a new generation which is the problem of the government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who make the tools that we need to tackle things in common .
it &apos;s not just the code for america &apos; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country to stand up and write <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know what we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget about politics and the snake with the <unk> and all the other things that we &apos;re really upset about is government , in the essence of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we &apos;re doing we can &apos;t do . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to do that , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their power to us -- <unk> yourself : &quot; we are the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , in the government , i thought it &apos;s about to choose people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s all about communities .
that &apos;s the call center for service and information .
you usually come out of when you &apos;re <unk> in your town .
if you &apos;ve ever been able to have the opportunity to work in your <unk> call , as our fellow scott <unk> , as part of the program -- in fact , do you all -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who are going to call the government for many different problems , including that a <unk> in your house .
so , scott gets this <unk> .
he &apos;s typing &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . it starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open up all the doors in your house and see very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause of scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call center .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is work very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in this : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happened to <unk> is different .
scott talk from human beings .
but in &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we got , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yeah . alive ? <unk> .
turned on the site . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is what digital is true of the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into this .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped a different citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have related them to be able to connect them to government services , if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a very much better and cheaper to state services .
if a neighbor of the other helps , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but you think that &apos;s an input from the other .
that our contribution is to the system .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we lean back and we expect the government to reflect our values and their needs , and then didn &apos;t change much ?
that &apos;s because the government is a further ocean and politics are the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word in like this .
but it &apos;s these contempt that we own , and for which we pay , we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s working against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
so we need to be against the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned <unk> citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which one answer to the <unk> is about <unk> .
this is not politically active , which is <unk> active .
well , for those of us who gave up the government , it &apos;s time that we &apos;re thinking about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to give you the enormous challenges you have to ask .
do we really believe that we do what we need to do without improving an institution that can be in the name of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to become more efficient .
now the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by raising society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things in common , you have to just build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with their voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we all fight , about who to talk to you ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can make your mind on every channel , every time , and they do it .
so when you &apos;re faced with the problem of the government , they don &apos;t care so much about their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of the government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be , a fire hydrant , a weed to <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
and sure , we would have <unk> this <unk> all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of the government to pay taxes and receive accomplishment .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government to improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got here : if it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
normally , my role in how my role in explaining to people is how wonderful the new technologies , which are at the rise , are going to be , and i thought , because i &apos;m here in my friends , i &apos;d like to tell you what i really think is , and to understand what &apos;s going on here , with this incredible <unk> to the beginning that we barely think .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a little , boring slide .
... if you could just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve selected from my folder .
i &apos;m not talking about the details of the slide , but rather is the overall shape .
this slide shows an analysis from an analysis to the performance of organ processors compared to the power of a <unk> area .
and what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , as many others , which we find in our field , is a kind of <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a potency in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this type of scale on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
slightly brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
the reason for that is , if i could draw it on a regular curve , where , let &apos;s say that this is the years , so the timeline one , and this is a random measure of the technology that i want to show with a graph , the graph is <unk> .
so they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to map another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then this would be very <unk> on the <unk> scale , in a flat line .
but if something like this is happening here , that changes the <unk> conditions .
so if it was as fast as the <unk> progression would make progress , then we could get <unk> into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
we &apos;ve never had it before in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is a kind of <unk> growth for all of the years .
so the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponential curves , you can see it &apos;s not always going on .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever evolved forever and over forever as fast as now .
there are two possibilities .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> like here until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really like that , then that &apos;s what we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i &apos;m a lot of myself , is what this new world is going to be ?
what is this new condition to take the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future still lies in 2000 .
when we &apos;re not going to go .
so in other words , the future is about a year since i was in this world every year .
i think the reason is that we know something is happening .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense of trying to look at the future or 50 years to look into the future , because everything is going to be so different from what we &apos;re doing now simply not make sense .
now , i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are at the moment .
and to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things , which really don &apos;t do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life on earth .
i think the big picture makes sense when you divided it into a couple of ice stations .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s a 2.5 billion years of earth . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you &apos;ve been looking at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they &apos;re doing it .
i also believe there are theories that start to understand like rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of what is that time , small <unk> <unk> , which <unk> different kinds of chemicals in chemicals in chemicals .
some of these <unk> had a special combination of chemicals , which allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow .
all of those were , it began to tile .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> .
however , these <unk> were not about living in the sense of today , because each one of them was just a small , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they have spread chemicals into the disparate quantities .
so every <unk> was a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> , which one for the growth of the growth had faster than others and integrated and more integrated from the outside and shared faster .
so , this tended to survive longer and to survive them into <unk> extent .
so that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it will be if this <unk> learned a trick of abstraction .
now , in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , this is the ability to learn the ability to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and that is in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have found a way in this <unk> , evolutionary way that allowed them to be made of what they were , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing is that this kind of thing is to store information over a 2.5 billion years of the time where it was born , the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same spelling .
and that is the exact same letter using exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are , as far as we do , just to be able to write ourselves in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports of <unk> .
there is -- what i &apos;ve done is -- what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is from normal letters that we use to <unk> -- and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and have 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everybody in this room and even everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a <unk> , i would have written them on a virus and open into space .
so what is the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step in which things were completely different , and that is that these cells began to communicate and share information as the communities were born .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , it grows into antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and they have written together with other bacteria together in the dna , and now we have lots of bacteria , which is resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria to each other is .
now these conversations now allow the reasons of communities , which were in a certain sense of the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survived together , or they were going together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were more repeated and <unk> by evolution .
now , the <unk> is where these communities are so close to <unk> , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that point we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the plane , in which evolution happened , no longer was the single cell , but the whole thing that we call organism .
the next step is within these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that made nothing different from the organism in the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have built up these <unk> .
they started to train in specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning to understand and capture from information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point an individual -- it &apos;s happened in the period of time of a individual organism , rather than that evolutionary period .
so an organism could do , for example , learning to eat a certain fruit because she liked bad and he made him sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of an organism , whereas before hundreds of thousands of years have been needed , because this information has had to be learned from the individuals who died because of those fear , there were no there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> with this particular <unk> , because evolution could be within an individual place .
it could take place within time .
what happened then is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
now , as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a rather amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically going to give a <unk> sound of me in the hope to create a similar <unk> idea in your head , which has some resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sounds , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in your heads .
so this allows us again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we &apos;ve done humanity , we started abstract .
we go through the same steps , which <unk> have gone through -- the abstraction of our methods to capture , process , process .
for example , the invention of the language was a small step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle that information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to evolve faster than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> little <unk> , where he &apos;s shown a little bit of evolution in &quot; <unk> , &quot; right in front of your eyes .
so now we have <unk> <unk> .
the first steps of history , which i told you , is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> several hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades away .
the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> is the word for this -- if some of its <unk> increases .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself .
i live a living from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use to build computers , not to use , without the recent advances in computing .
my current activity is to make objects such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what &apos;s the designers of thinking <unk> , is that we think on a certain <unk> , this is the machine , and the machine makes something that is going to our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do it themselves .
and it &apos;s in part of the ways we don &apos;t even understand until now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using recently is evolution itself .
and this is what we put in the machine in the machine , which is going on in the <unk> .
in order to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , please take a hundred million randomly chosen sequences from the instructions .
now , please take all of these randomly chosen instructions , all of the programs that are coming out , and then finally choose the ones that i &apos;m going to be at the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to be numbers , which would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for that .
so find programs that can sort the most like numbers .
and , of course , the chance of elected elected elected elected , is very small , that you just get numbers , so you don &apos;t think the instructions actually do this .
but one of them may be two numbers on the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve come to the next one .
store them , <unk> the rest .
now , <unk> <unk> , which are the numbers of the best .
and that &apos;s with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the features of the <unk> of two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that arose by combinations of programs , which are something closer to us than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
get back again .
maybe lead some mutations .
and try it again with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through an evolution over millions of years in a computer within a few minutes , or a few hours a few hours .
and finally , i get programs that can sort the numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever have by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s abstruse and odd programs .
but they do the job done .
i know , and i &apos;m sure they do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
i sat once in a 747 with marvin <unk> , he <unk> a card and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there &apos;s this airplane made of <unk> <unk> , which are working together to make your flight more secure . &apos; don &apos;t make you <unk> ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal if it &apos;s too complicated .
so let &apos;s start leaving computers , for a process which is very different from classical engineering .
he allows us to have things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of this .
so <unk> <unk> gives us the technology .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computers much faster , so that we &apos;re able to make these processes even faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so puzzling .
because all these new technologies are feeding itself .
we &apos;re raising up .
we &apos;re at a point where analog is at the time , the analog is designed to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really see what the hell we &apos;re actually doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think there &apos;s something else after us .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we &apos;re the end of the evolution of evolution .
and i think that all of us here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here now , before i &apos;m going to <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about it that hasn &apos;t changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to go to indians at the time , we went into a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability that i can enjoy the sunset , without a camera and no tweet about my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and <unk> in my imagination .
and i came up with it as we were holding out to our fancy clocks and cameras out of it .
they were holding up by being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use the magic to allow them to make magic rather than killing .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling the readers can connect throughout the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
that storytelling has always more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i get a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
and the kid in me is really excited about this kind of thing .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean with a magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass , i always found it quite exciting .
so you &apos;ve got to pour up the ipad , and the fireflies are <unk> .
and the light of light is light by the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a galaxy can put a whole galaxy in a single <unk> .
and therefore , here &apos;s a book , and every world is a little <unk> , which i put here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always maps , but these maps were static .
and this map grows and it &apos;s <unk> , and it serves for guidance in the rest of the book .
she also shows the other way of the book .
i go in here .
and it &apos;s important for me to create something that is <unk> , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside of india know about their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> chambers in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary story for children .
a story that said to new issues like the <unk> .
on the theme of <unk> , a big problem for the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , on their own computers , without a <unk> .
but now , using mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in one interaction , you &apos;re sent to a search . you &apos;ve got to go out and get pictures of the camera of the ipads images .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
you know , the kids don &apos;t do more .
this is going to be <unk> . you have to go out to make a picture of one flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to take a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can ask online .
a child in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to do an interaction where you used the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , a animation of <unk> is seeing the <unk> of <unk> that appear to a plant of the house .
in one place , the screen is filling up with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , read it away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of the technology are closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and the magic , fun , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest and in places where there are lots of hopelessness .
to be here at ted , looking at how stimulating this is , has given me a lot of power .
now , in the short time here , i realized , ted has an identity .
you can tell things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes when there &apos;s something about ted , it gets meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of the teacher is meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good , and as a doctor , you can do good .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i &apos;ve not learned this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i grew up in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who was dominated by a <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in any <unk> .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in <unk> in virginia .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and i &apos;d come down .
and she pushed me so stuck that i could barely breathe . then they let me go .
one or two hours later , when i encountered her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , feel that you &apos;re still having my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she said me again . if i said , &quot; yes , let me be quiet .
it was something that made that you wanted to be close to her .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine that i woke up one morning and in living room , all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and staring at me .
first i thought that was a game .
and i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very seriously .
it was so 15 or 20 minutes , and she stood up and came to me , and she took me over and said , &quot; come on , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i , we need to talk .
i still remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t get it out . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to be watching you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; the first thing she said is , you &apos;re going to love your mama . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom &apos;s my baby , and you have to promise you to take care of them . &quot;
i raised my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , next to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to you is , &quot; you never get alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is a year older and one year a year .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with my sister and i went to the forest .
we &apos;re just <unk> around there , like else .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister , and she took me , and then offered me to one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , ok . do you just do . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; well , do you do . now we do that , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had what , you know , your sister had a beer . go ahead of a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . do you just do . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , what ? &quot;
and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to do you right now because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma told all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll confess something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do this .
this is maybe going to transmit in public .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i <unk> that i never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that &apos;s because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people things that they don &apos;t think of .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all your grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in jail during <unk> in prison .
my uncles died in <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we would care about .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest world &apos;s tallest .
seven million people are discharged on <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , we have changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population of despair , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black between 18 and 30 in prison , in prison , go to prison , go to prison on <unk> or <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles of philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men either in prison , in jail , on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not only shaped by questions that have <unk> to do , and it &apos;s also becoming poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country where they &apos;re guilty and guilty and guilty as poor and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , affect the result .
yet we seem to be very happy with that .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost touch .
i find this interesting .
there &apos;s some <unk> developments there .
my home state state , alabama is <unk> , permanently , <unk> the <unk> .
and here today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population is lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the civic <unk> will be as high as the <unk> of the urban .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , who sentenced to children &apos;s children in jail .
in this country , there are children in this country for children who are in a sense of <unk> .
we have a lot of practice .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe , because we &apos;ve taught it so that the real question is , has a human being to die for one of the people of the crime ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : anybody deserves a crime of death , but : do we make it kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people that we were executed , one that we found was one that we were sitting in for innocent found , who was released and on death row .
there &apos;s an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let someone fly to a plane , if for nine planes , you would start off .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race , and the question of whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m talking to my students african history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time at the end of the <unk> , to the beginning of the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you talk , you &apos;re going to talk about , you tell the people that you should stop saying that we have to stop it for the first time in our nation .
they say , &quot; no -- you say the people that we grew up with . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> willing surrender and apartheid .
and yet there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what our actions do in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly running together .
we always create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the <unk> didn &apos;t get over without the willingness to go to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness to do , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept a couple of talks about the death penalty in germany .
and it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up to my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear you like that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , they can never give you in germany . &quot;
it was still silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we will ever kill ourselves for the systematic thing .
it would be <unk> of us , aware of people . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where the german state people had <unk> <unk> , especially if there were a lot of jews in there .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re facing people -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted of death , 11 times higher when the victim is black and the victim , in the same states , in the same states , in the same state , in its earth .
and yet there &apos;s these mental <unk> <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult topics , then the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> of <unk> , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more engagement , more engagement , more dedication to be in a complex world .
and for me , for me , it means to create , thinking and talk about the poor , the <unk> , who will never be at ted .
but think of a way of thinking in our own life .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re rational as well , so we appreciate intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just coming out of our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s these <unk> , which i believe is not only to be open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , has said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do all kinds of things , but what we needed most of the most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in <unk> places and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe in the essence of what i think you have to get involved .
there &apos;s not a distinction there &apos;s technology and design that allows us to be very , very much , as long as we don &apos;t get eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
she will touch you deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege of hitting the pink parks .
the parks always came back to <unk> , where they were two of their oldest friends <unk> these older women , <unk> <unk> , who organized the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were meeting and they were just talking .
and by the time , the woman <unk> me and said , &quot; <unk> , woman parks coming into the city . we want a conversation .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
and i went over and just stopped .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i sat there , and after a few hours , woman turned to me and turned to me , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what it is in the same way that &apos;s right .
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
<unk> want people to help people who have been convicted .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to abolish <unk> <unk> without a single way of <unk> for children .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual lecture , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very tired . &quot;
and then he said to me in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so they must be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think that the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to make ways of making these challenges : these problems , that suffering .
because , ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a very simple stuff .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to him , it &apos;s not just a plant .
even who kills someone , not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s , there &apos;s a fundamental human being to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i believe in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so exhilarating , we can &apos;t be measured by our technology , not in the things that we develop , not in the things that we develop .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the convicted , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . it &apos;s a story .
sometimes i urge you .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are going ahead of our thinking in a very important way .
i <unk> these kids who were convicted of very hard punishment .
i go into <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , to stand as an adult .
and then i wonder , how could that happen ?
how can a judge can turn into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i stayed too long at night , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should wish to you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think better , i started working on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor young boys as clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline said , &quot; listen , my poor , <unk> black clients like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
in my bill , i explained that <unk> was the <unk> and the police and <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there are no more error .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i dreamed of these crazy bill or in fact .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t just have written him , but sent to the court .
a few months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to give you into court , and this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to the dish .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
finally , i went from my car and went to the dish .
when i was on the stairs to the court , there was an older man , black man , the janitors in the court .
and when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he made me the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute every one , something to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i entered the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you ask this mad bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people always came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , was that we were angry about skin language , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors and go off .
he always looked through the window and could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on and down .
finally , this older black man came up with a very <unk> man who sat down in the <unk> and sat straight down , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
during the break , the <unk> came in , which was upset that the janitors were in <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give the goal .
i came to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far <unk> , but it &apos;s the justice of the <unk> .
we &apos;re not fully designed to be completely designed unless we care about human rights and <unk> .
that we are all survival with survival every one .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and creation of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who are just seeing that , just say , just don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community , a obvious wish , and belongs to helping them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well there are possibilities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to company , something about <unk> <unk> , which is in the politics of punishment .
here , for example , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to get a billion dollars for death rates in a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all <unk> doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
56 percent of all <unk> are not coming in trial .
here &apos;s a chance to do something .
so this <unk> is going to suggest to invest in more <unk> and security .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the <unk> in america is enormously down .
and that &apos;s a fact that often has been asked in a relationship with increased <unk> .
what would you tell someone that believes ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t really have changed .
the vast majority of the <unk> in this country was not really in the class of <unk> .
it was <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come in in a prison .
we have <unk> from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , which will bring people behind bars for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft , rather than that you force them to give back to the sacrifice of the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current should not help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they actually brought a string up here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is an increased <unk> .
<unk> in somalia : famine , three : spray the police .
four : malignant <unk> . speaker : dangerous <unk> .
six : social decline . speaker has seven : 65 dead .
eight : <unk> . 9 : <unk> .
different speaker : <unk> . mass destruction . tornado .
recession . gridlock . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media is to prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds are given attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second , our senses will catch much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because it &apos;s nothing more important than our survival is the first stop for all the information , part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our <unk> , our <unk> .
it turns out and <unk> all the information on the search for any <unk> of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it <unk> , is rising to the demand .
now , with all of our digital devices , the seven days of all the week , 24 hours a day of all these negative messages is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s going to be worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
that &apos;s probably the reality .
perhaps the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so strongly that it will be possible for us in the next three decades , a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , water , water , <unk> -- we have .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better to see problems in a very long term , but eventually they &apos;re going to overcome it .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which is <unk> in inflation to inflation , the world has tripled .
child mortality has a tenth of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs are lower .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful period of life .
and charles <unk> has gone from 25 percent in the last 130 years of 25 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
remember , a lot of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , refrigerators , refrigerators , cell phones , <unk> , <unk> and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have been able to dream like this .
so the basis of a lot of these are creating technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my great friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to get to the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is doubling every 12 to 24 months 24 and 24 months .
that costs the mobile phone in your pocket about a million times less and more thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it is -- in good like for bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , building faster computers .
they &apos;re slowing down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your logarithmic <unk> on the left side , she &apos;s up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that would call my friends in autodesk , call sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , that allow the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer watson in &quot; risk ? &quot;
that was great .
i once looked at newspapers , looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human opponent . &quot;
the risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence were available to each owner of the <unk> .
four years ago , now , ray kurzweil , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies , based on special focus on how these are being used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create products and products and services , within a decade , that can affect billions of people &apos;s lives .
think about that a group of students can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , it would have been ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done this .
and when i think that abundance of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for anybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating <unk> surplus .
the scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resources of <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he was invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> was getting <unk> .
aluminum was at that time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than the gold and <unk> .
this is the reason why the dome of <unk> was made of aluminum .
even though aluminum &apos;s <unk> is not going to get a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of <unk> was developed and made it so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we &apos;re thinking about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with <unk> more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost of solar solar into 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar has dropped by 50 percent last year .
last month , this was published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in sunny areas of the united states , we &apos;re going to be 15 cents a <unk> , compared to 15 cents on the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , then we &apos;ll have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> in 1990 , when it was on saturn <unk> , turned back to earth ?
he took a famous picture . what was it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue dotcom . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the road , <unk> .
and from a conversation today , this morning with dean <unk> , one of the innovators for doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , the &quot; <unk> &quot; , and perhaps many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a <unk> .
it can produce a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine , and all this for less than two cents a liter .
the chairman of coca-cola has just been <unk> to launch a big <unk> with a hundred units in developing countries .
and when everything is good , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola is going to apply to the technology global in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there is today .
and we &apos;ve seen this on mobile phones .
you &apos;re my goodness , we &apos;re going to do the 70 percent <unk> of mobile phones in developing countries , to the end of 2013 .
remember , a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya in the middle of kenya a better <unk> , when president reagan has 25 years ago .
and if you &apos;re looking for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication and communication , as nobody could have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you &apos;ve spent , and i spent a thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photo , libraries of books and music for medical diagnostics -- are now literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is perhaps what we expect in health .
i had the pleasure of pleasure in the last month with the <unk> &quot; $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize to announce .
we demand teams all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone , that you can talk to the device , because you can test <unk> , you can test or test your <unk> .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . right in a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the employees of health care .
if this device sequenced a <unk> or a computer sequence that &apos;s not known , it calls it to disease , and prevents a pandemic .
but now the biggest force that we &apos;re going to lead to a world of excess .
i call it &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and just by the way , the largest <unk> against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition around the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we grow up from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , are going to link global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to desire ?
and instead of modern gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and you &apos;re going to be able to use it through the use of the <unk> healthier , and they &apos;re getting better training through the <unk> , and by doing that , you &apos;re going to use the opportunity , 3d printers and <unk> computing and so more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion , healthy , educated , productive , productive members of the <unk> we have ?
it &apos;s like a sentence new , never before <unk> voices .
what about the oppressed , the oppressed , wherever they are , are to give a voice to make sure and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people will bring ?
how about <unk> we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned through the x prize is that little teams who are motivated by passion and focus , are extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and government only in the past .
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with .
it &apos;s a game called foldit solved .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein is going to evolve .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far , this was a problem of supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people that play the game online .
and it turns out that today , the human pattern today is better to make the proteins that folds into the best supercomputer .
and when these people came up and looked at who &apos;s the best <unk> of the world , this was not a <unk> , no <unk> , it was a woman from england , manchester , a woman who was working as an assistant at the day in a <unk> and the best <unk> of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i have tremendous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to put us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to address the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i believe that we have to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been a long time in business , as i can give it to me a piece of my own false <unk> to allow this .
but before i &apos;m talking about the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the <unk> close to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and turn to the statistics , and to use this to use these great baseball baseball .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about 300 when a bat &apos;s beating .
that means that the player is definitely beating three of 10 beats .
that means the ball beat up , he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not caught , and he &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t have any time , and the runners was in security .
three from 10 .
you know what &apos;s called a <unk> <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s one of the only one of them in the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player who met during the <unk> season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine in medicine , where i feel more comfortable , or maybe a little less than i talked to you about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be a <unk> , which is a <unk> 400 in terms of <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine they &apos;re living in a certain remote area , and they have a loved person with <unk> <unk> , and her <unk> <unk> <unk> this to a <unk> , which is <unk> at <unk> .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s much better this year . she &apos;s on the <unk> branch .
and she &apos;s suggesting a <unk> .
it somehow doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the medicine knows that no one should be a good surgeon or doctor or <unk> .
but what we do , though , is that every one of them was locked up in the world to be perfectly perfect .
never make a mistake , no one &apos;s doing the details about how to do this .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
i was a obsessive <unk> student .
in high school time , a <unk> <unk> said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters at the toronto general hospital , <unk> <unk> .
i learned everything .
i learned the origins and flat of any <unk> , every branch of any artery , which <unk> the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i started getting more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i went down with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school medical school with the impression that i was memorized and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as much as possible , as possible as possible , that i was immune to making mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met my wife .
i was <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman printer in toronto , to me in the <unk> of the hospital .
at that point i was the <unk> layer of the <unk> service .
and it was my mission to look at when the <unk> <unk> advice was looking for <unk> .
and to give feedback to my <unk> .
and i was examined a printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest with the <unk> , i was able to hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering from <unk> failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails , instead of pump the entire blood up , there &apos;s a part of the blood vessels in the lung , and they fill up these gradually , so the <unk> came .
and that was not hard to be diagnosed .
i asked them , and i did the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave you the medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so that she <unk> the liquid .
and over a half and a half , and a half , you started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on to them and did what i should have , which would have been a call on my <unk> , so that he &apos;d had a chance to have a single picture .
and he knew her , he &apos;d been able to get extra information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so could be able to take responsibility that i was so being able to worry about my patients without having to contact with it .
my second mistake was worse .
and by doing that , i sent them home , i &apos;m a quiet voice to me , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , in fact , i was so much about the nurse , asked me to ask the nurse , which was a real printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and i said , in <unk> , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;ll go well . &quot;
i remember thinking about it yesterday .
so i took the <unk> and an ambulance and an ambulance and got them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , that the hospital and went to a parking lot to go home with the car when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
i went through the <unk> on my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after wife &apos;s printer , but another three words to me and these three words fear that i know .
other people are also afraid of this as well , but the <unk> is especially because we only see the patients .
three words loud : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients who were going to be home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and they die .
about an hour after she arrived at home , after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and they brought them back on the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous effect .
she hardly <unk> and was blue .
the <unk> made all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them on the <unk> .
i was shocked , and i was in the internal <unk> .
and i lived through this rollercoaster , because she came to the intensive care unit , and i hoped that she was going to recover .
and after two , three days realized she was never going to awakening again .
she didn &apos;t have suffered a <unk> injury .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they went through the <unk> .
the <unk> day you go , you go -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you never forget the names of the never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next couple of weeks i &apos;d claims , and i found out the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s best friend , even though this one gets up on <unk> , and you &apos;ll get the best friend to be faced with it , and you <unk> that one thing in the end , however , you never make such a mistake .
if you do <unk> , and you never do it again .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes a <unk> sick .
it &apos;s the one who tells you that &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my <unk> , he was very happy .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he had to be <unk> and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why did i get them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go in medicine ?
slowly , but it certainly put it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out , and i might say , maybe i can feel better again .
and i was about that if i &apos;ve doubled my efforts to perfect , and never again <unk> a mistake that the voice could <unk> .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in <unk> in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a <unk> man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of go and i have a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked into the <unk> and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him away .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed him to his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to give me a conversation in her office .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out to be a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but the top <unk> and the base of the <unk> .
and fortunately he died .
he got <unk> <unk> , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt free , and went out and went back to work and again and again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve missed two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of things , especially when you think that in a hospital , you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i sent them home , and there were probably not a <unk> of their treatment .
and i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the x-ray of the kidneys . when it was without <unk> , my colleague in the bottom of the patient , on the lower right-hand sector , and called the <unk> .
the other one had severe diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him , and i asked my colleagues also to study him .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he had a <unk> on the right sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was fine .
both of those cases <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only happened in the first five years of what many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can talk about the quiet voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i go into a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you have the last time from <unk> talking about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your mistakes .
if i had a room full of colleagues and ask for you to ask her immediate support and start telling them what i just told you about , i &apos;m very likely to do not the end of the second story , but i &apos;m really not going to do any of the end of the second story .
and in fact , if i knew , or my colleagues know that a <unk> in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg , you believe me , i would have trouble looking at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those of the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . the ones that <unk> <unk> , and the without limitation , with bad outcomes and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies to attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we ban those who make the mistakes from the medicine that we have a system that is safe .
but there are two problems .
in my roughly , about 20 years of <unk> and journalism , i created a personal medical study study about medical errors and false treatments , so all of my first article , which i was doing for the toronto , &quot; white <unk> , black style . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system that would happen every day in which one of 10 <unk> are either wrong or wrong , in the <unk> , and to always be numbers , and devastation or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die in <unk> errors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine did the number of 100,000 .
both of them are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> where medical wisdom is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , make it <unk> and <unk> and give it a slightly <unk> breath , and all of a sudden the story is <unk> .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things always .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are error inevitable .
so if you take the system like this , as i &apos;ve taught it , and all the <unk> <unk> is edited out , then there &apos;s no one left .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my program , &quot; white <unk> , black type , &quot; i &apos;ve got the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about your microphone ? &quot;
and then their pupils expand , they came up with the head , and look down the head , look down and swallow , and start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , do not make the same mistake i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is an environment that puts them in a position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
what the doctor is defined is a human , white knows to make his humanity , accepted it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all going to learn from them so that it can be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
you supported if others are talking .
and it shows others their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a <unk> , supportive way that all benefit from it .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if it &apos;s so , people make mistakes in time .
so that the system is that the system evolved to create <unk> that make it easier to find that people do inevitably , and also to create loving spaces in which everyone who &apos;s observed in health care , also to be able to address the potential mistakes , and it will actually respond to people like me to make the potential error and even reward .
my name is brian goldman sachs .
i &apos;ve defined the doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to get out of it to pass it out .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you probably know that he was <unk> here .
they may be thinking that he hunted <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he collected fish .
he described one of them as &quot; usual . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
and in the &apos; 80s , he &apos;s been in big scale .
now , it &apos;s the red list here .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they were originally .
they still describe them as pristine .
what happened here ?
the second story is to make another concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was in a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i was going to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a terrible <unk> , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really did it .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon were <unk> and in a few mangroves .
there were <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen were good about it and they were making them good than people in ghana .
when i returned , when i returned , the fish had shrunk to half its size .
adults measure it five centimeters .
they were genetically engineered .
they were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also fortunate to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it has changed .
my third little story tells me of my favorite little story in the introduction of southeast asia .
in the 1970s , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , europe has a lot of <unk> europe .
<unk> meant countries that have already started 100,000 fish , the industrial fishery called this fairly ugly ship called the industrial fishery .
i was driving on that , and we made it out in the southern sea of sea and especially in the <unk> sea .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially , the ocean comes down , and then it became <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you have a survey , and it starts with the commercial fishing fishing .
the reason is going to change . it &apos;s in this case -- a hard reason , or soft corals are going <unk> crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , they threw it away because they were dead .
once we started alive .
it was not <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them .
in fact , this mountain of rubble is going to have accumulated every time that , in fact , to drive up in areas that have never been discovered .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our <unk> to the new level , and we don &apos;t think of what was there .
if you zoom in , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are some of the good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of the country , the <unk> .
with the time it changes . it &apos;s changing , because the people are very natural .
each generation is looking at the images that you take in the beginning of your conscious life , as the standard and becomes all of that .
the difference is perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be the order of change .
and at the end , they just want to get the highest remains .
now that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that disappeared , or things that are not more like they were .
now , you could think that the problem was in people who certainly lived when they lived in <unk> societies , and they were killing them after a few generations of what they did .
because , obviously , an animal that was very often , even rarely , before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose any natural animals .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as big loss .
and with that time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and in the ocean that &apos;s the big fish .
they become less rare because we start .
and over time , little fish left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept this .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people are becoming , scientists , confirm it .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence as you are in a earlier shape , they &apos;re not like the evidence to describe the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a <unk> like this , which was in this area of great <unk> , can &apos;t be used , or don &apos;t normally become <unk> , because it &apos;s not <unk> .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in sophisticated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role of a marine reserve .
because through marine areas , we basically think about the past .
we can imagine the past that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> changes have changed and very low .
and so the people who see a marine reserve , and that benefit from the insight that it allows you to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have access to -- people in the midwest in the midwest ?
so , i think the art and the film maybe fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people have been touched by this -- aside from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in some ways .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is of cameron , so he &apos;s <unk> &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist <unk> , you had to be able to register a typewriter on the government .
they also had to register a sheet with <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could find the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like that , and how much of freedom of speech would be cut .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new <unk> of the top of the top of the world &apos;s top and a page , that page , yellow <unk> on every page , <unk> <unk> on each side , in a pattern that makes the page clearly on them and your printer .
this is happening today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments are doing the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at what &apos;s happening in the world : we can divide the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> in ukraine in ukraine .
and the themes of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are multiple cases of <unk> , <unk> that have made their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
that &apos;s alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people are online online , but they &apos;ve been illegal to have acquired it , by using <unk> , to claws money out of our <unk> , or also <unk> , who are taking our <unk> on the input through the keyboard , or to buy a infected computers online .
the u.s. intelligence agency two months ago this swiss account for mr. sam jain here , and in this account account , <unk> million dollars had been frozen when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on free foot , which is unknown is unknown .
and i want to argue that it &apos;s more likely to be victims of a brain crime as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be even worse .
in the future , most crime will play online .
the second largest amount we can see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests are like an opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over for the last 12 months and have become a <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who do it for the money , <unk> like anonymous , who afford resistance , but the last group are nations , governments that lead the attacks .
we &apos;re going to think about , like the <unk> .
it &apos;s an idea of what happens when governments can attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or it was that .
last fall , it had to sign up <unk> , because <unk> was hacked .
and somebody was hacked , and they had been hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior question to see if he could make it possible for the <unk> people who had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a row of a remote hacks ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , if you have a website with <unk> of service , for example , gmail .
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of us , but these services are particularly common in <unk> states like gmail , because they know they can use more trust such as gmail , because they know that the local government can &apos;t be in their conversation so that the local government can &apos;t get in their conversation .
but can you , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
<unk> , <unk> and fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of <unk> .
what about the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt for example ?
well , in the u.k. , in april 2011 , the headquarters in april 2011 , the headquarters for egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a folder was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were a local company that the egyptian government sold a couple of programs that they had -- very large framework -- all communication of egyptian citizens could catch .
they had this program for example of the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments , western governments , governments can be able to work against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for instance , in germany , just a few weeks ago in the so-called <unk> , this was a <unk> that was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , it &apos;s pretty much secure your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
they use resources like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , to collect their <unk> .
so , if we keep thinking about things like this , the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not to me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
it has to be given privacy .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , the year of 2011 , our governments like trust , but every right that we &apos;re going to be emitted .
and do we trust that we &apos;re blind to any future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions we have to engage with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made by <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> from cement , which fit together .
<unk> became very quickly <unk> in the world .
they gave us to build things that were larger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , it has become the <unk> of the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego that came out .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically called rock . &quot;
and within less years , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 rocks for each person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for all possible .
lego has basically made the <unk> , the building block of the world , and made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , at bell labs the next revolution , the next revolution announced the next one .
the transistor was a little <unk> , which is a world of static , <unk> building blocks to a world that was all interactive .
like the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much more complex loops , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is for experts , so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to study this idea how to put the power of engineers into artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets .
so they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is cable .
so all you need to do is to connect a blue and a green green one , and they can build very quickly into larger <unk> .
they add a blue one on a green green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and they made a little <unk> .
take the switch out to be a <unk> , which is here in this , and they made a little <unk> .
you add that <unk> for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
and beyond the simple play , is actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , you have to code , <unk> , or <unk> , allows you to program your intuitive , intuitive gestures .
so , to speed up the brain or slow it down , you just turn on this button and it makes it slower faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world in a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> in children and see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start understanding the electronics in the world , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors for the <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we also brought <unk> to <unk> .
so , for example , we had no experience of designers in electronic things that began to play with more <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a couple of weeks ago , we took risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a lobster , which is fear in the darkness .
for those <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so it &apos;s open source .
you can go to the website , download all of the <unk> and you can make them yourself .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , encourage you , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and start to invent it .
thank you .
